<p>Disease characteristics. Autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia (designated AD-CMD in this review) is characterized by progressive diffuse hyperostosis of cranial bones evident clinically as wide nasal bridge, paranasal bossing, wide-set eyes with an increase in bizygomatic width, and prominent mandible. Development of dentition may be delayed and teeth may fail to erupt as a result of hyperostosis and sclerosis of alveolar bone. Progressive thickening of craniofacial bones continues throughout life, often resulting in narrowing of the cranial foramina, including the foramen magnum. If untreated, compression of cranial nerves can lead to disabling conditions such as facial palsy, blindness, or deafness (conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss). In individuals with typical uncomplicated AD-CMD life expectancy is normal; in those with severe AD-CMD life expectancy can be reduced as a result of compression of the foramen magnum.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings that include diffuse hyperostosis of the cranial base, cranial vault, facial bones, and mandible and metaphyseal widening and radiolucency in the long bones. Molecular genetic testing of ANKH, the only gene known to be associated with AD-CMD, is available on a clinical basis. Mutations in other as-yet unknown genes may also be causative.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Treatment consists primarily of surgery to reduce compression of cranial nerves and the brain stem/spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. Severely overgrown facial bones can be contoured; however, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common.</p>

<p>Surveillance: regular neurologic evaluation, hearing assessment, and ophthalmologic examination, at intervals determined by the individual's history and severity of skeletal changes.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. AD-CMD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Many individuals with AD-CMD caused by a mutation in ANKH have an affected parent, but de novo mutations are frequent in simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family). Each child of an individual with AD-CMD has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for AD-CMD is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known.</p>
