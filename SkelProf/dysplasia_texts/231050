<p>Disease characteristics. Geleophysic dysplasia, a progressive condition resembling a lysosomal storage disorder, is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, progressive joint limitation and contractures, distinctive facial features, progressive cardiac valvular disease, and thickened skin. Intellect is normal. Major findings are likely to be present in the first year of life. Cardiac, respiratory, and lung involvement result in death before age five years in approximately 33% of affected individuals.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings. Molecular genetic testing of ADAMTSL2, the only gene known to be associated with geleophysic dysplasia, is available on a research basis only.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: regular physiotherapy to prevent joint limitation; cardiac valve replacement as needed. Tracheostomy as required. Surveillance: annual multidisciplinary examination to access height; joint range of motion; echocardiography for evidence of valvular stenosis and/or arterial narrowing; clinical assessment for evidence of tracheal stenosis and respiratory compromise; clinical assessment and ultrasound examination for liver size if needed.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Geleophysic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible through laboratories offering custom prenatal testing if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known.</p>
