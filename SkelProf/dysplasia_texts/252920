<p>Sanfilippo syndrome B is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate. Clinically, patients have progressive neurodegeneration, behavioral problems, mild skeletal changes, and shortened life span. The clinical severity ranges from mild to severe (Chinen et al., 2005).</p>
