<p>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because this form of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is caused by mutation in the PLEKHM1 gene.</p>

<p>For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, see OPTB1.</p>

<p>Based on their findings in the 'incisor absent' (ia) rat model of osteopetrosis (van Wesenbeeck et al., 2004) that implicated the PLECKHM1 gene, van Wesenbeeck et al. (2007) analyzed that gene in 43 patients diagnosed with various forms of osteopetrosis. In a girl with an intermediate form of osteopetrosis, born of consanguineous parents, they identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation (<a href="/entry/611466#0001">611466.0001</a>). The patient was found to have an 'Erlenmeyer flask' deformity of the distal femora by radiography at age 7 years; at 14 years of age, she had left leg pain while walking and was found to have chondrolysis of the left hip. No other clinical symptoms were reported. Her unaffected parents and a clinically and radiographically normal older brother were heterozygous for the mutation; an asymptomatic younger brother who was homozygous for the mutation had dense metaphyseal bands noted on radiography at the ages of 8 months and 2 years. The mutation was not found in 100 control chromosomes. Electron and confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that monocytes from the patient and her brother homozygous for the mutation differentiated into osteoclasts normally, but when cultured on dentine discs, the osteoclasts failed to form ruffled borders and showed little evidence of bone resorption.</p>
