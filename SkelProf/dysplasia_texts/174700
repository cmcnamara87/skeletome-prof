<p>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that some cases of preaxial polydactyly type IV are caused by mutation in the GLI3 gene.</p>

<p>Although both preaxial polydactyly and syndactyly are cardinal features of this malformation, it is classified as a form of polydactyly because syndactyly does not occur in the absence of polydactyly (McClintic, 1935), the opposite not being true. On the other hand, polysyndactyly is here classified as a type of syndactyly because polydactyly (of the third or fourth fingers and fifth toes) does not occur in the absence of syndactyly. The thumb shows only the mildest degree of duplication, and syndactyly of various degrees affects fingers 3 and 4. The foot malformation is more constant and consists of duplication of part or all of the first or second toes and syndactyly affects all of the toes, especially the second and third. Thomsen (1927) described 10 affected females and 5 affected males in 5 generations. McClintic (1935) observed 15 affected in 5 generations, and Goodman (1965) 5 affected in 3 generations.</p>

<p>Baraitser et al. (1983) pointed out that the digital changes of this disorder are identical to those of Greig syndrome (GCPS;); that the facial features of Greig syndrome can be so mild as to be indistinguishable from the normal; and, therefore, that delineation of type IV preaxial polydactyly (uncomplicated polysyndactyly) as a distinct entity (Temtamy and McKusick, 1978) is not certain. Reynolds et al. (1984) reported 21 affected persons in 5 generations. Variability in expression without apparent sex influence and with complete penetrance was noted. The deformities were more severe in the feet than in the hands. Anteroposterior flatness of the thumbs was the only manifestation of the trait in the hands of several affected family members. X-rays of the thumbs in a pictured case showed dysplastic distal phalanges with a central hole--a most curious and perhaps specific finding of type IV preaxial polydactyly.</p>

<p>It is possible that this is the same disorder as that called type I crossed polydactyly (CP1) by Ishikiriyama et al. (1991). Crossed polydactyly (CP) is defined as coexistence of preaxial and postaxial polydactyly with discrepancy in the axes of polydactyly between hands and feet. CP is divided into 2 types: in type I, postaxial polydactyly of the hands is combined with preaxial polydactyly of the feet; in type II, the opposite is found. CP is often associated with congenital malformation syndromes, while nonsyndromic CP is rare. McClintic (1935), Goodman (1965), and Giorgini et al. (1979) reported families with CP type I. Abnormal earlobes were present in the family reported by Goldberg and Pashayan (1976); see. Most patients in these families showed not only preaxial polydactyly of the feet but also syndactyly of toes II-V. In the family studied by McClintic (1935), there were 6 fingers and 7 toes. Ishikiriyama et al. (1991) described a Japanese mother and son with CP type I. Unlike the affected members of the previously reported families, syndactyly of the toes was not present.</p>

<p>Radhakrishna et al. (1999) demonstrated a 1-nucleotide frameshift insertion (<a href="/entry/165240#0005">165240.0005</a>) resulting in a truncated protein of 1,245 amino acids in a family with preaxial polydactyly type IV.</p>

<p>In a father and son with preaxial polydactyly type IV, Fujioka et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the GLI3 gene (R290X; <a href="/entry/165240#0014">165240.0014</a>). The authors noted that the son also had syndactyly of the third and fourth fingers on his left hand, whereas his father had no abnormalities of his hands, indicating that phenotypic variation may be seen between cases of preaxial polydactyly with identical mutations in GLI3.</p>

<p>Biesecker and Johnston (2005) raised the question of whether there was sufficient phenotypic evidence to rule out a diagnosis of GCPS in the father and son reported by Fujioka et al. (2005). Fujioka and Ariga (2005) noted that Baraitser et al. (1983) had reported that facial features of Greig syndrome can be so mild as to be indistinguishable from normal and had suggested that preaxial polydactyly type IV may be Greig syndrome.</p>
