<p>The mucopolysaccharidoses are a family of lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficiencies of enzymes required for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans. The defects result in accumulation of excessive intralysosomal glycosoaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) in various tissues, causing distended lysosomes to accumulate in the cell and interfere with cell function. Multiple types have been described (Mok et al., 2003).</p>
