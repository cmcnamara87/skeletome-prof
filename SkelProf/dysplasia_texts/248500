<p>Alpha-mannosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease of glycoprotein catabolism caused by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase activity. The disorder shows a wide range of clinical phenotypes, from a severe infantile form (type I), which is fatal at less than 3 to 8 years of age, to a less severe juvenile- or adult-onset form (type II), which ultimately shows progressive neurologic degeneration (summary by Gotoda et al., 1998).</p>
