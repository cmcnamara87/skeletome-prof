<p>Disease characteristics. Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is characterized by (1) upper-extremity malformations involving radial, thenar, or carpal bones; (2) a personal and/or family history of congenital heart malformation, most commonly ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD), especially those occurring in the muscular trabeculated septum; and/or (3) cardiac conduction disease. An abnormal carpal bone is present in all affected individuals and may be the only evidence of disease. Seventy-five percent of individuals with HOS have a congenital heart malformation.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of HOS is based on established clinical criteria and can be confirmed through clinically available molecular genetic testing. More than 70% of individuals who meet strict diagnostic criteria have an identifiable mutation in TBX5.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Management entails a multidisciplinary team approach involving specialists in medical genetics, cardiology, orthopedics, and hand surgery. Affected individuals and families are also likely to benefit from programs providing social support to those with limb anomalies.</p>

<p>Surveillance: annual ECG for all affected individuals, annual Holter monitor for individuals with known conduction disease, and echocardiogram every one to five years for those with septal defects.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. HOS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 85% of affected individuals have HOS as the result of de novo mutations. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of being affected. In pregnancies at 50% risk, detailed high-resolution prenatal ultrasound examination may detect upper-limb malformations and/or congenital heart malformations. Prenatal molecular genetic testing may be used to confirm ultrasound findings in families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected relative.</p>
