<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC, also known as Sanfilippo syndrome C, is caused by a deficiency of alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (<a href="http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/nicezyme.pl?2.3.1.3" target="_blank">EC 2.3.1.3</a>), an enzyme with properties of a lysosomal membrane transporter (Ausseil et al., 2004).</p>

<p>Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis III, comprises several forms of lysosomal storage diseases due to impaired degradation of heparan sulfate. The deficient enzyme in MPS IIIC is an acetyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-glucosaminide residues to N-acetylglucosaminide in the presence of acetyl-CoA. For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of Sanfilippo syndrome, see MPS IIIA.</p>
