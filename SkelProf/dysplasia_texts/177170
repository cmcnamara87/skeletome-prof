<p>Pseudoachondroplasia is an autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature, deformity of the lower limbs, brachydactyly, loose joints, and ligamentous laxity. Vertebral anomalies, present in childhood, usually resolve with age, but osteoarthritis is progressive and severe. PSACH and EDM1 comprise a clinical spectrum with phenotypic overlap between mild forms of PSACH and EDM1 (Briggs and Chapman, 2002). PSACH affects at least 1 in 20,000 individuals (Tufan et al., 2007).</p>
