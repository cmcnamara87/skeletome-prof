<p>Disease characteristics. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is characterized by exocrine pancreatic dysfunction with malabsorption, malnutrition, and growth failure; hematologic abnormalities with single- or multi-lineage cytopenia and susceptibility to myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML); and bone abnormalities. In almost all affected children, persistent or intermittent neutropenia is a common presenting finding, often before the diagnosis of SDS is made. Short stature and recurrent infections are common.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of SDS relies on clinical findings, including pancreatic dysfunction and characteristic hematologic problems. SBDS is the only gene currently known to be associated with SDS. Molecular genetic testing is clinically available.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team is recommended. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Blood and/or platelet transfusions may be considered for anemia and bi- or trilineage cytopenia. If recurrent infections are severe and absolute neutrophil counts are persistently 500/mm3 or less, treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) can be considered. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be considered for treatment of severe pancytopenia, MDS, or AML.</p>

<p>Prevention of secondary complications: aggressive dental hygiene to promote oral health. Consider prophylactic antibiotics and G-CSF to reduce risk of infection during complex dental procedures or orthopedic surgery.</p>

<p>Surveillance: assessment of development, growth, and nutritional status every six months. Complete blood counts at least every six months. Following baseline examination, bone marrow examination every one to three years or more frequently if bone marrow changes are observed.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged use of cytokine and hematopoietic growth factors (such as G-CSF) should be considered with caution. Case reports have indicated that standard preparative regimens for HSCT with cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide and busulfan may lead to cardiac toxicity; milder ablation regimens are being considered.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. SDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most parents of children with SBDS mutations are carriers; however, de novo mutations have been reported. When both parents are known to be carriers, the sibs of a proband have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an unaffected carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for relatives at risk and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both disease-causing mutations in a family are known.</p>
