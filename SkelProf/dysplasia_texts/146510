<p>Disease characteristics. Pallister-Hall syndrome (referred to as PHS in this entry) is characterized by a spectrum of anomalies ranging from polydactyly, asymptomatic bifid epiglottis, and hypothalamic hamartoma at the mild end to laryngotracheal cleft with neonatal lethality at the severe end. Individuals with mild PHS may be incorrectly diagnosed as having isolated postaxial polydactyly type A. Individuals with PHS can have pituitary insufficiency and may die as neonates from undiagnosed and untreated adrenal insufficiency.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of Pallister-Hall syndrome is based on family history and the clinical findings of hypothalamic hamartoma, central and postaxial polydactyly, bifid epiglottis, imperforate anus, and renal abnormalities. Molecular genetic testing of GLI3, the only gene known to be associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome, is available clinically.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Urgent treatment for endocrine abnormalities, especially cortisol deficiency; management of epiglottic abnormalities depending on the abnormality and the extent of respiratory compromise; bifid epiglottis, the most common abnormality, typically does not need treatment. Standard treatment of anal atresia or stenosis; symptomatic treatment of seizures; elective repair of polydactyly; developmental intervention or special education for developmental delays.</p>

<p>Prevention of secondary complications: Biopsy or resection of hypothalamic hamartoma may result in complications and lifelong need for hormone replacement; seizures may begin or worsen with use of stimulants for attention deficit disorder.</p>

<p>Surveillance: During childhood, annual developmental assessment and annual medical evaluation to assess growth and monitor for signs of precocious puberty.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Pallister-Hall syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with PHS may have an affected parent or may have the disorder as the result of a de novo mutation. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. The risk to offspring of an affected individual is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. The reliability of ultrasound examination for prenatal diagnosis is unknown.</p>
