<p>Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans is considered to be a distinct disorder from classic Crouzon syndrome, which is caused by mutation in the FGFR2 gene. Cohen (1999) argued that this condition is separate from Crouzon syndrome for 2 main reasons: it is caused by a highly specific mutation of the FGFR3 gene, whereas multiple different FGFR2 mutations result in Crouzon syndrome, and the phenotypes are different.</p>
