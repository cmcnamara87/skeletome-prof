<p>Disease characteristics. The otopalatodigital (OPD) spectrum disorders, characterized primarily by skeletal dysplasia, include: otopalatodigital syndrome type I (OPD1), otopalatodigital syndrome type II (OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD), and Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS). In males, severity ranges from mild manifestations in OPD1 to more severe presentations in FMD and OPD2; prenatal lethality is most common in males with MNS. Females exhibit variable expressivity. In OPD1, most manifestations are present at birth; and females can present with severity similar to affected males, but some have only mild manifestations. In OPD2 and FMD, females are less severely affected than related affected males. Most males with OPD2 die during the first year of life, usually from thoracic hypoplasia resulting in pulmonary insufficiency. Males who live beyond the first year of life are usually developmentally delayed and require respiratory support and assistance with feeding. In FMD, males do not experience progression of skeletal dysplasia but may have joint contractures and hand and foot malformations. Progressive scoliosis is observed in both males and females. In MNS, wide phenotypic variability is observed; some individuals are diagnosed in adulthood, while others require respiratory support and have reduced longevity.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical examination, radiologic studies, family history consistent with X-linked inheritance, and molecular genetic testing. FLNA is the only gene currently known to be associated with the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders. Molecular genetic testing (sequence analysis) of FLNA detects mutations in exons 3-5 in 43% of individuals with OPD1; mutations in exons 3-5 and 28-29 in 69% of individuals with OPD2; mutations in exons 3-5, 22, 28-29, and 44-47 in 57% of individuals with FMD; and mutations in exon 22 in 100% of individuals with MNS.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Hearing aids for deafness. Cosmetic surgery may correct the fronto-orbital deformity; orthopedic surgery may correct scoliosis.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Monitor for hearing loss and orthopedic complications including scoliosis.</p>

<p>Testing of relatives at risk: Consider molecular genetic testing for the family-specific mutation in at-risk relatives.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. The OPD spectrum disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. If a parent of a proband with OPD1, OPD2, or FMD has the FLNA mutation, the chance of transmitting the mutation in each pregnancy is 50%. When the mother has an FLNA mutation, males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation have a range of phenotypic expression. Males with OPD2 do not reproduce; males with OPD1 or FMD transmit the disease-causing mutation to all of their daughters and none of their sons. If the mother of a proband with MNS has the FLNA mutation, the chance of transmitting the mutation in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the mutation will be affected and usually die prenatally or perinatally; females who inherit the mutation have a range of phenotypic expression. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known.</p>
