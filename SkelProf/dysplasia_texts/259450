<p>Bruck syndrome is characterized by congenital contractures with pterygia, onset of fractures in infancy or early childhood, postnatal short stature, severe limb deformity, and progressive scoliosis (McPherson and Clemens, 1997).</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Bruck Syndrome</p>

<p>Bruck syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. Bruck syndrome-1 maps to chromosome 17p12. Bruck syndrome-2 is caused by homozygous mutation in the PLOD2 gene on chromosome 3q23-q24. Van der Slot et al. (2003) stated that they were unaware of any phenotypic differences between the 2 forms.</p>
