<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by intracellular accumulation of keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. Key clinical features include short stature, skeletal dysplasia, dental anomalies, and corneal clouding. Intelligence is normal and there is no direct central nervous system involvement, although the skeletal changes may result in neurologic complications. There is variable severity, but patients with the severe phenotype usually do not survive past the second or third decade of life (Montano et al., 2008).</p>

<p>McKusick (1972) noted that between 1929 and 1959, a miscellany of skeletal disorders was included in the Morquio category, including various types of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (see, e.g.,) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (see, e.g.,).</p>

<p>Nelson et al. (1988) proposed the division of MPS IVA into 3 subgroups: severe classic, intermediate, and mild, reflecting clinical variability observed in 12 enzymatically proven cases. Those who were only mildly affected showed a relatively high residual enzyme activity.</p>
