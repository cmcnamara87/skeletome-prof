<p>Disease characteristics. Typical Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is characterized by preaxial polydactyly or mixed pre- and postaxial polydactyly, true ocular hypertelorism, and macrocephaly. Individuals with mild GCPS may have subtle craniofacial findings. The mild end of the GCPS spectrum is a continuum with preaxial polysyndactyly type IV and crossed polydactyly (preaxial polydactyly of the feet and postaxial polydactyly of the hands plus syndactyly of fingers 3-4 and toes 1-3). Individuals with severe GCPS can have seizures, hydrocephalus, and intellectual disability.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of GCPS is based on clinical findings and family history. Standard Giemsa-banding cytogenetic studies can detect translocations or gross cytogenetic deletions involving 7p13. FISH analysis detects deletions in the estimated 5%-10% of individuals with large deletions involving band 7p13; comparative genomic hybridization array may become an alternative to FISH in the future. GLI3 is the only gene known to be associated with GCPS; GLI3 alterations (i.e., cytogenetic abnormalities involving GLI3 or mutations of GLI3) can be identified in more than 75% of typically affected individuals. Testing for GLI3 sequence alterations is clinically available.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: elective surgical repair of polydactyly with greatest priority given to correction of preaxial polydactyly of the thumbs; evaluation and treatment as needed for hydrocephalus or other CNS abnormalities in individuals showing signs of increased intracranial pressure, developmental delay, loss of milestones, and/or seizures.</p>

<p>Surveillance: monitoring for evidence of OFC increasing faster than normal.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. GCPS either is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (either as a mutation in GLI3 or as a deletion of 7p13 involving GLI3) or occurs as the result of a de novo or inherited chromosomal rearrangement. Individuals with GCPS as the result of a GLI3 mutation may have an affected parent or may have the disorder as the result of a de novo mutation. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown. Each child of an individual with a GLI3 mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the underlying genetic cause in the family (i.e., deletion of 7p13, balanced chromosomal rearrangement, or GLI3 mutation) has been identified. The reliability of ultrasound examination for prenatal diagnosis is unknown.</p>
