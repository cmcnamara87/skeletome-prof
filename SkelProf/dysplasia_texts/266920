<p>This association was reported in 2 patients by Mainzer et al. (1970) and in 1 patient by Popovic-Rolovic et al. (1976). Robins et al. (1976) observed similar skeletal changes and hepatic fibrosis with renal dysplasia.</p>

<p>Giedion (1979) summarized the cases of 8 patients under the age of 11 years with chronic renal failure and phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses of the hands, coining the term 'conorenal syndrome.' Half of Giedion's patients had retinitis pigmentosa and 25% had ataxia. Giedion (1979) reported nephronophthisis in his patients; however, neither biopsy material nor clinical course was available to confirm that diagnosis.</p>

<p>Mendley et al. (1995) extended the delineation of the conorenal syndrome to include renal histopathologic and clinical features of a primarily glomerular disorder. They reported 2 sibs, aged 7 and 19 years, with cone-shaped phalangeal epiphyses and renal disease that was different in nature and rate of progression from cases previously described: the clinical features of nephronophthisis (medullary cystic kidney disease) were absent and, while the younger sib had reached end-stage renal disease, the older sib's renal function was only modestly impaired and had remained nearly unchanged for several years. The brother and sister were of Mexican extraction. The 7-year-old sister had prominent cone-shaped epiphyses in the distal phalanges and cone-shaped epiphyses in the middle phalanges of the index and fifth fingers. The 19-year-old brother had very short distal phalanges, some of which appeared flexed, and the middle phalanges of the second and fifth digits were markedly short. Both parents were phenotypically normal; hand radiographs in the mother were normal without signs of cone-shaped epiphyses. Percutaneous renal biopsy showed global scarring and acellularity of many glomeruli in both sibs.</p>

<p>Beals and Weleber (2007) provided follow-up on one of the patients originally described by Giedion (1979). The patient was then 40 years old. He had been found to have severe bilateral renal disease consistent with chronic pyelonephritis at age 2 years. He subsequently underwent multiple renal transplants, one of which lasted for over 30 years, and at the time of report was on dialysis. He was noted to have cataracts and exotropia at age 5 years. Electroretinography (ERG) at age 12 demonstrated decreased scotopic (rod-mediated) and moderate depression of the photopic (cone-mediated) b-wave response, suggesting an atypical, nonpigmented, primary retinal degeneration. Cataracts, thought to be the result of chronic steroid treatment, were removed in his twenties. By age 38, ERG revealed further progression of retinal degeneration. Fundal examination at age 40 showed early bone-spicula pigment deposits. Review of radiographs performed in childhood revealed cone-shaped epiphyses in the proximal and middle phalanges of the hands and feet. Hand radiographs at age 37 demonstrated mild shortening and deformity of the middle phalanges without evidence of cone-shaped epiphyses. A healthy 9-year-old son of the patient had normal hand radiographs and no history of kidney disease.</p>
