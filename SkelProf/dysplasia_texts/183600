<p>Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM) is a limb malformation involving the central rays of the autopod and presenting with syndactyly, median clefts of the hands and feet, and aplasia and/or hypoplasia of the phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals. Some patients with SHFM1 have been found to have mental retardation, ectodermal and craniofacial findings, and orofacial clefting (Elliott and Evans, 2006).</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Split-hand/Split-foot Malformation</p>

<p>One locus for split-hand/foot malformation, SHFM1, has been mapped to chromosome 7q21.</p>

<p>Additional loci include SHFM2 on chromosome Xq26; SHFM3, caused by duplication of chromosome 10q24; SHFM4, caused by mutation in the TP63 gene on chromosome 3q27; SHFM5 on chromosome 2q31; and SHFM6, caused by mutation in the WNT10B gene on chromosome 12q13.</p>

<p>A form of SHFM1 with deafness (SHFM1D;) has also been described.</p>
