<p>Fanconi anemia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder that causes genomic instability. Characteristic clinical features include developmental abnormalities in major organ systems, early-onset bone marrow failure, and a high predisposition to cancer. The cellular hallmark of FA is hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and high frequency of chromosomal aberrations pointing to a defect in DNA repair (summary by Deakyne and Mazin, 2011).</p>

<p>Soulier et al. (2005) noted that the FANCA, -C, -E, -F, -G, and -L proteins are part of a nuclear multiprotein core complex which triggers activating monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein during S phase of the growth cycle and after exposure to DNA crosslinking agents. The FA/BRCA pathway is involved in the repair of DNA damage.</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Fanconi Anemia</p>

<p>Other Fanconi anemia complementation groups include FANCB, caused by mutation in the FANCB on chromosome Xp22; FANCC, caused by mutation in the FANCC on chromosome 9q22; FANCD1, caused by mutation in the BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12; FANCD2, caused by mutation in the FANCD2 gene on chromosome 3p25; FANCE, caused by mutation in the FANCE gene on chromosome 6p22-p21; FANCF, caused by mutation in the FANCF gene on chromosome 11p15; FANCG, caused by mutation in the XRCC9 gene (FANCG;) on chromosome 9p13; FANCI, caused by mutation in the FANCI gene on chromosome 15q25-q26; FANCJ, caused by mutation in the BRIP1 gene on chromosome 17q22; FANCL, caused by mutation in the PHF9 gene (FANCL;) on chromosome 2p16; FANCM, caused by mutation in the FANCM gene on chromosome 14q21.3; FANCN, caused by mutation in the PALB2 gene on chromosome 16p12; FANCO, caused by mutation in the RAD51C on chromosome 17q22; and FANCP, caused by mutation in the SLX4 gene on chromosome 16p13.</p>

<p>The previously designated FANCH complementation group (Joenje et al., 1997) was found by Joenje et al. (2000) to be the same as FANCA.</p>
