<p>Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (ATD), also known as Jeune syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia characterized by a severely constricted thoracic cage, short-limbed short stature, and polydactyly. It often leads to death in infancy due to respiratory insufficiency. Affected individuals who survive early childhood usually develop chronic cystic renal and hepatic disease (Oberklaid et al., 1977). Other features include retinal degeneration (Bard et al., 1978) and pancreatic cysts (Hopper et al., 1979).</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dysplasia</p>

<p>Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. ATD1 has been mapped to chromosome 15q13. See also ATD2, caused by mutation in the IFT80 gene on chromosome 3q; ATD3, caused by mutation in the DYNC2H1 gene on chromosome 11q; and ATD4, caused by mutation in the TTC21B gene on chromosome 2q24.</p>
