<p>Grebe chondrodysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe abnormality of the limbs and limb joints (summarized by Thomas et al., 1997). The severity of limb shortening progresses in a proximal-distal gradient, with the hands and feet being most affected. The fingers and toes lack articulation and appear as skin appendages. In contrast, axial skeletal structures and the craniofacial skeleton are not affected. Heterozygous individuals are of average stature and have mild skeletal abnormalities.</p>
