<p>An historically notable example is the Scipion family in which the malformation was transmitted for over two thousand years (Manoiloff, 1931). The thumb is replaced by one or two triphalangeal digits, which may or may not be opposable (Swanson and Brown, 1962). The feet, in some cases, show preaxial polydactyly of the 1st or 2nd toes (Manoiloff, 1931; James and Lamb, 1963). A constant radiologic finding is distal epiphysis for the metacarpal of the accessory digits (Swanson and Brown, 1962).</p>
