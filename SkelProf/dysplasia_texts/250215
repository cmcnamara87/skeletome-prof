<p>Based on 2 unrelated personal cases and a pair of sibs from the literature, Verloes et al. (1991) delineated a 'new' category of bone dysplasia with cup-shaped, large metaphyses. They suggested the name metaphyseal acroscyphodysplasia ('acro-' refers to limb; 'scypho-' comes from scyphus, meaning cup). The main clinical features were severe growth retardation, micromelia predominating in the lower limbs, knee flexion, and severe brachydactyly. The radiologic appearance of the knees was considered specific: the lower femoral and upper tibial epiphyses were embedded in the metaphyses, which were severely cup-shaped. Premature central epiphyso-metaphyseal fusion and gross deformation, or even coalescence, of the femoral condyles, occurred. Femoral diaphyses were short and broad, and there was progressive coxa valga. Bowed and/or short stubby tibias with cone-shaped metaphyses, and varus deformity of the tibio-astragalian joint were other features. Slight deformation of the long bones occurred in the arms. The main signs of hand involvement were severe brachydactyly, brachymesophalangy, phalangeal and metacarpal cone-shaped epiphyses, and irregular, bent, and shortened diaphyses. One of the 2 unrelated cases had abnormal facies but was mentally normal; psychomotor retardation was present in 3 of 4 cases. The affected sibs, a boy and his sister, were reported by Bellini et al. (1984). One of these sibs had abnormal hair (see). Verloes et al. (1991) considered autosomal recessive inheritance very likely.</p>

<p>Kozlowski et al. (1995) reported 2 sisters with distinctive radiographic features that combined cone-shaped epiphyses and cupped metaphyses of distal femora with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. The distinctive metaphyseal appearance at the knees was also described by Verloes et al. (1991) and characterized by association of the metaphyseal changes with very short hands and feet. Kozlowski et al. (1995) concluded that there is more than one bone dysplasia that presents with these distinctive radiographic knee appearances but that because of too few cases, no satisfactory classification of a group of disorders is possible.
