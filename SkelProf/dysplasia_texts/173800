<p>Poland syndrome consists of unilateral absence or hypoplasia of the pectoralis muscle, most frequently involving the sternocostal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, and a variable degree of ipsilateral hand and digit anomalies, including symbrachydactyly. Sometimes called Poland sequence, it was first described by Poland (1841).</p>

<p>Poland syndrome is most commonly a sporadic condition (David, 1982; Opitz, 1982), but familial cases have been reported.</p>
