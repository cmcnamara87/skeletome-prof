<p>Disease characteristics. Feingold syndrome is characterized by digital anomalies (shortening of the 2nd and 5th middle phalanx of the hand, clinodactyly of the little finger, syndactyly of toes 2-3 and/or 4-5, thumb hypoplasia), microcephaly, facial dysmorphism (short palpebral fissures and micrognathia), gastrointestinal atresias (primarily esophageal and/or duodenal), and mild to moderate learning disability.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Molecular genetic testing of MYCN, the only gene known to be associated with Feingold syndrome, is available on a clinical basis.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Gastrointestinal atresia is treated surgically. Renal and cardiac anomalies are treated in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Feingold syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 60% of individuals with Feingold syndrome have an affected parent; the proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown. Each child of an individual with Feingold syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family has been identified.</p>
