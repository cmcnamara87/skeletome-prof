<p>Disease characteristics. Cleidocranial dysplasia (referred to as CCD in this review) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by delayed closure of the cranial sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, and multiple dental abnormalities. Manifestations may vary among individuals in the same family. The most prominent clinical findings are abnormally large, wide-open fontanels at birth that may remain open throughout life; mid-face hypoplasia; abnormal dentition, including delayed eruption of secondary dentition, failure to shed the primary teeth, supernumerary teeth with dental crowding, and malocclusion; clavicular hypoplasia resulting in narrow, sloping shoulders that can be apposed at the midline; and hand abnormalities such as brachydactyly, tapering fingers, and short, broad thumbs. Individuals with CCD are shorter than their unaffected sibs and are more likely to have other skeletal/orthopedic problems such as pes planus, genu valgum, and scoliosis. Other medical problems include recurrent sinus infections and other upper-airway complications, recurrent ear infections, high incidence of cesarean section, and mild degree of motor delay in children under age five years.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis of CCD is based on clinical and radiographic findings that include imaging of the cranium, thorax, pelvis, and hands. RUNX2 (CBFA1) is the only gene known to be associated with CCD. Molecular genetic testing of the RUNX2 gene detects mutations in 60%-70% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CCD. Such testing is available on a clinical basis.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: dental procedures to address retention of deciduous dentition, presence of supernumerary teeth, and non-eruption of the permanent dentition. Such procedures may include prosthetic replacements, removal of the supernumerary teeth followed by surgical repositioning of the permanent teeth, and a combination of surgical and orthodontic measures for actively erupting and aligning the impacted permanent teeth. Speech therapy may be required during periods of dental treatment. Aggressive treatment of sinus and middle ear infections; tympanostomy tubes are considered for recurrent middle ear infections. If the cranial vault defect is significant, the head needs protection from blunt trauma; helmets may be used for high-risk activities. If bone density is below normal, treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation is considered. Preventive treatment for osteoporosis should be initiated at a young age. Surveillance: Children should be monitored for orthopedic complications, dental abnormalities, upper-airway obstruction, sinus and ear infections, and hearing loss. Monitoring for osteoporosis begins in adolescence. Pregnant women with CCD should be monitored for cephalopelvic disproportion.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Cleidocranial dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo mutation is high. Each child of an individual with CCD has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known.</p>
