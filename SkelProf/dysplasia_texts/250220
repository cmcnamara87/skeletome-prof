<p>Sedaghatian (1980) described an Iranian family with 3 sibs, 2 boys and a girl, with severe metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, mild rhizomelic shortness of the upper limbs, and mild platyspondyly. All 3 died in the first days of life of 'cardiorespiratory insufficiency.' The one studied biochemically showed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Autopsy in the same infant showed pulmonary, renal and adrenal hemorrhage, subendocardial myocarditis, and myocardial necrosis. Parental consanguinity was denied. Opitz et al. (1987) reported a second Iranian family, in which 2 males were affected; the parents were related as first cousins. In the offspring of a young black couple related as first cousins (with no known Iranian ancestry), Peeden et al. (1992) observed a third instance of this lethal form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. The male infant developed complete heart block in the newborn period; there was no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus in the mother. He died at 2.5 days of age.</p>

<p>Elcioglu and Hall (1998) presented the radiologic findings in 2 unrelated patients with the Sedaghatian type of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. From a review of cases, they concluded that disproportionately long fibulas, disharmonious maturation, and turricephaly are usual features.</p>

<p>Koutouby et al. (2000) reported a case of this disorder in an infant born to nonconsanguineous Yemeni parents. Although all previously reported cases had died within 4 days of life, this patient survived 161 days. The patient was profoundly hypotonic, and MRI of the brain showed grossly abnormal cortical development with lack of myelination of the underlying white matter. The ribs showed a V-shaped border at the posterior ends.</p>

<p>English et al. (2006) reported a female infant, born to nonconsanguineous Caucasian parents, who had severe metaphyseal dysplasia with platyspondyly and V-shaped notching of the posterior ribs. The infant was hypotonic and experienced recurrent cyanotic episodes within a few hours of delivery; she developed seizures at day 14 and died at 17 days of age after experiencing increasingly frequent prolonged apneic episodes. Brain MRI revealed absence of the corpus callosum and marked frontotemporal pachygyria, providing further support for the existence of neuronal migration abnormalities in Sedaghatian spondylometaphyseal dysplasia.</p>
