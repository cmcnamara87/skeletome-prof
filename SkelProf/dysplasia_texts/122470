<p>Disease characteristics. Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is characterized by distinctive facial features, growth retardation (prenatal onset; <5th centile throughout life), hirsutism, and upper-limb reduction defects that range from subtle phalangeal abnormalities to oligodactyly. Craniofacial features include synophrys, arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, small upturned nose, small widely spaced teeth, and microcephaly. IQ ranges from below 30 to 102 with an average of 53. Many individuals demonstrate autistic and self-destructive tendencies. Frequent findings include cardiac septal defects, gastrointestinal dysfunction, hearing loss, myopia, and cryptorchidism or hypoplastic genitalia.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis of CdLS is clinically based on the presence of craniofacial features, growth failure, intellectual disability, limb abnormalities, and hirsutism. NIPBL and SMC1A (formerly SMC1L1) are the only genes currently known to be associated with CdLS. Mutations in NIPBL are identified in 50% of individuals with CdLS; molecular genetic testing is clinically available. Mutations in SMC1A are identified in a small percentage of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CdLS; molecular genetic testing is clinically available.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Management for CdLS includes treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and correction by fundoplication if it is severe and surgical correction of intestinal malrotation. Supplementary formulas and/or gastrostomy tube placement meet nutritional needs when there is failure to thrive. Surgery is performed for limb defects that hinder utilization or mobility. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies optimize development. Sign language and the picture exchange communication system facilitate communication. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is aggressively treated and orchiopexy is performed if cryptorchidism is present.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. CdLS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or in an X-linked manner. The vast majority of affected individuals have a de novo mutation; fewer than 1% of individuals diagnosed with NIPBL-related CdLS have an affected parent. The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the parents. Each child of an individual with NIPBL-related CdLS has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband has been estimated to be 1.5% because of the possibility of germline mosaicism. The risk to sibs of a proband with SMC1A-related CdLS depends on the carrier status of the proband's mother. Prenatal testing is clinically available for families in whom the NIPBL disease-causing allele has been identified. Prenatal diagnosis for families in whom an SMC1A mutation has been identified may be available through laboratories offering custom prenatal testing.</p>
