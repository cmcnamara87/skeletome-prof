<p>Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) is a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, mesomelia, and Madelung wrist deformity. Although the disorder occurs in both sexes, it is usually more severe in females, perhaps due to sex difference in estrogen levels. However, pubertal development and fertility are generally normal in both sexes with the disorder (summary by Ross et al., 2005). The Madelung wrist deformity includes deformity of the distal radius and ulna and proximal carpal bones (Langer, 1965).</p>
