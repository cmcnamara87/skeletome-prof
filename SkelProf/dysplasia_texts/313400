<p>Disease characteristics. In adults, X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (X-linked SEDT) is characterized by disproportionately short stature with short trunk and arm span significantly greater than height. At birth, affected males are normal in length and have normal body proportions. Affected males exhibit retarded linear growth beginning around age six to eight years. Final adult height is typically 4'10" to 5'6". Progressive joint and back pain with osteoarthritis ensues; hip, knee, and shoulder joints are commonly involved but to a variable degree. Hip replacement is often required as early as age 40 years. Interphalangeal joints are typically spared. Motor and cognitive milestones are normal.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of X-linked SEDT, which relies upon a combination of clinical and radiographic features, is usually possible in childhood. Adolescent and adult males have disproportionately short stature with a relatively short trunk and barrel-shaped chest. Upper- to lower-body segment ratio is usually about 0.8. Arm span typically exceeds height by 10-20 cm. Characteristic radiographic findings, which typically appear prior to puberty, include multiple epiphyseal abnormalities; platyspondyly (flattened vertebral bodies) with characteristic superior and inferior "humping" seen on lateral view; narrow disc spaces in adulthood; scoliosis; hypoplastic odontoid process; short femoral necks; coxa vara; and evidence of premature osteoarthritis beginning in young adulthood. TRAPPC2 (SEDL) is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause X-linked SEDT. Molecular genetic testing reveals a mutation in SEDL in more than 80% of males with a clinical diagnosis of X-linked SEDT.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Surgical intervention may include joint replacement (hip, knee, shoulder) or spine surgery (correction of scoliosis or kyphosis). Standard chronic pain management preceding or following orthopedic surgery is often required.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Annual follow-up for assessment of joint pain and scoliosis; and cervical spine films prior to school age and before any surgical procedure involving general anesthesia to assess for clinically significant odontoid hypoplasia.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities and occupations that place undue stress on the spine and weight-bearing joints.</p>

<p>Testing of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic testing in males at risk may obviate unnecessary diagnostic testing for other causes of short stature and/or osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. X-linked SEDT is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. In reported cases in which molecular genetic testing was performed, all mothers of affected sons, regardless of family history, were carriers of a mutation in SEDL. Carrier females have a 50% risk of transmitting the SEDL mutation in each pregnancy: males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and will not be affected. None of the sons of an affected male will be affected; all daughters will be carriers of the SEDL mutation. Carrier testing of at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family has been identified.</p>
