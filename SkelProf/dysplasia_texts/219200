<p>Disease characteristics. ATP6V0A2-related cutis laxa, also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A (ARCL2A), spans a phenotypic spectrum that includes Debr√©-type cutis laxa at the severe end and wrinkly skin syndrome at the mild end. Affected individuals have furrowing of the skin of the whole body that improves with time. They may have other evidence of a generalized connective disorder, including enlarged anterior fontanelle in infancy, congenital dislocation of the hips, inguinal hernias, and high myopia. In most (not all) affected individuals, cortical and cerebellar malformations are present and are associated with severe developmental delays, seizures, and neurologic regression.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis is based on characteristic findings on clinical examination of the skin, serum sialotransferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF), serum apolipoprotein C III IEF, and molecular genetic testing of ATP6V0A2, the only gene known to be associated with this disorder.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), repair of inguinal hernia(s), routine management of hip dislocation, and psychological help as needed for self-image issues.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination.</p>

<p>Other: It is best to avoid plastic surgery in infancy or childhood because the skin findings tend to improve with age.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. ATP6V0A2-related cutis laxa is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible if the two disease-causing mutations in the family are known. Prenatal testing is available for families in which the disease-causing mutations are known.</p>
