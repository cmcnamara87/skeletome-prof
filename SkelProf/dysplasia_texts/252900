<p>The Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis III, is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease due to impaired degradation of heparan sulfate (Esposito et al, 2000). The disorder is characterized by severe central nervous system degeneration, but only mild somatic disease. Onset of clinical features usually occurs between 2 and 6 years; severe neurologic degeneration occurs in most patients between 6 and 10 years of age, and death occurs typically during the second or third decade of life. Type A has been reported (van de Kamp et al., 1981) to be the most severe, with earlier onset and rapid progression of symptoms and shorter survival.</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III</p>

<p>MPS III includes 4 types, each due to the deficiency of a different enzyme: heparan N-sulfatase (type A); alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (type B;); acetyl CoA:alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase (type C;); and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (type D;).</p>
