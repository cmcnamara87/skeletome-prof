<p>Multiple sulfatase deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism resulting in tissue accumulation of sulfatides, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sphingolipids, and steroid sulfates. The enzymatic defect affects the whole family of sulfatase enzymes; thus, the disorder combines features of metachromatic leukodystrophy and of various mucopolysaccharidoses (see, e.g., MPS6;). Affected individuals show neurologic deterioration with mental retardation, skeletal anomalies, organomegaly, and ichthyosis. Different types of MSD can be distinguished according to the age of onset: neonatal, late infantile (0 to 2 years), and juvenile (2 to 4 years). Neonatal MSD is the most severe form with a broad range of mucopolysaccharidosis-like symptoms and death within the first year of life. Late-infantile MSD, which includes the majority of cases, resembles late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy with progressive loss of mental and motor abilities and skeletal changes. There is also an attenuated form of late-infantile MSD with onset beyond the second year of life. Rare cases of juvenile-onset MSD have been reported with onset of symptoms in late childhood and slower progression (Blanco-Aguirre et al., 2001) (summary by Schlotawa et al., 2011).</p>
