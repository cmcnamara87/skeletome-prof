<p>Stoll et al. (1981) reported an apparently new form of autosomal dominant osteosclerosis. The patient (in her late 20s), her mother, and her youngest brother showed sclerosis of the pelvis and spine, with sparing of the skull, tubular bones, hands, feet, ribs, and clavicles. The head of the femur was also sclerotic bilaterally. Maroteaux (1980), who proposed the term 'osteomesopyknosis,' described 4 families, and Simon et al. (1979) described a family. Height in this disorder is normal. Patients may complain of low back pain or pelvic pain. The proband of Stoll et al. (1981) had 'ovarian sclerosis' and infertility. Radiographs at age 10 and in the late twenties were identical. Father-to-son transmission was observed in the family studied by Simon et al. (1979) and in the families studied by Maroteaux (1980). The disorder was present through several generations. The early reports all emanated from France, but a family with the condition was subsequently recognized in North America by Proschek et al. (1985). The condition designated axial osteomalacia by Whyte et al. (1981) may be the same disorder; despite the finding of osteosclerosis by x-ray, bone biopsy specimens showed osteomalacia.</p>
