<p>Schaefer et al. (1986) described a mother and her male infant affected with a craniotubular dysplasia characterized by severe craniofacial hyperostosis and sclerosis with obliteration of perinasal sinuses and foramina of the skull base. A severe bilateral hearing loss and facial diplegia with relative sparing of the optic nerves resulted. The long bones showed an extreme asymmetric hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses and evidence of a modeling defect in the metaphyses. The spine, ribs, clavicles, and pelvis all showed some degree of sclerosis and defective modeling but were less severely involved. Features distinguishing the disorder in these patients from the previously defined craniodiaphyseal dysplasia were a greater degree of hyperostosis and sclerosis, apparent dominant transmission, and metaphyseal involvement.</p>

<p>Bieganski et al. (2007) reported a boy with severe craniodiaphyseal dysplasia and his apparently unaffected mother. The boy had extensive osteosclerosis present at birth and the diagnosis of CDD was made at 4 weeks of age. His facial changes progressed with age with marked facial bone hyperplasia. He developed facial diplegia, bilateral conductive hearing loss, and optic nerve atrophy. At age 7, he developed progressive genu valgum and small cyst-like radiotranslucencies of the distal femoral epiphyses as seen in hyperparathyroidism. Metabolic studies revealed elevated PTH to 306.1 pg/ml (normal, 15-65 pg/ml) and serum alkaline phosphatase was 1491 IU/ L (normal, less than 455 IU/L). Total calcium was normal and serum phosphate was slightly decreased. A scan of the neck and chest showed a focus of increased tracer uptake corresponding to a parathyroid adenoma. Bieganski et al. (2007) noted some similarity in facial appearance between the mother and son. Radiographs in the mother revealed thickened, sclerotic bones of the calvarium and skull base. Leg and hand bones were normal. Biochemical studies revealed increased alkaline phosphatase and normal serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone. Bieganski et al. (2007) suggested that the mother had somatic and gonadal mosaicism, explaining her subclinical course and her severely affected son. Hyperparathyroidism had not previously been reported in CDD. Parathyroid hormone was normal in the patient reported by Schaefer et al. (1986) and elevated in a 5-year-old boy reported by Brueton and Winter (1990).</p>
