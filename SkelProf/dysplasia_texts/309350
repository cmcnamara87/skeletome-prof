<p>Melnick-Needles syndrome is 1 of 4 otopalatodigital syndromes caused by mutations in the FLNA gene. These disorders, including frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD;), otopalatodigital syndrome-1 (OPD1;), and otopalatodigital syndrome-2 (OPD2;), constitute a phenotypic spectrum. At the mild end of the spectrum, males with OPD1 have cleft palate and mild skeletal anomalies with conductive deafness caused by ossicular anomalies. FMD is characterized by a generalized skeletal dysplasia, deafness and urogenital defects. Males with OPD2 have disabling skeletal anomalies in addition to variable malformations in the hindbrain, heart, intestines, and kidneys that frequently lead to perinatal death. The most severe phenotype, MNS, is characterized by a skeletal dysplasia in the heterozygote. Affected males exhibit severe malformations similar to those observed in individuals with OPD2, resulting in prenatal lethality or death in the first few months of life (review by Robertson, 2005). Verloes et al. (2000) suggested that these disorders constitute a single entity, which they called 'fronto-otopalatodigital osteodysplasia.'</p>
