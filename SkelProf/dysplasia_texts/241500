<p>Hypophosphatasia is an inborn error of metabolism characterized clinically by defective bone mineralization and biochemically by deficient activity of the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase.</p>

<p>Fraser (1957) classified forms of hypophosphatasia according to age of onset: perinatal, infantile, childhood, and adult. Whyte (1988) indicated a fifth form of hypophosphatasia with primarily only dental manifestations, referred to as odontohypophosphatasia (see). All of these forms are allelic.</p>
