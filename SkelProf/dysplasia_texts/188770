<p>Eaton and McKusick (1969) reported a family in which 4 persons in 3 successive generations had bilateral hypoplasia of the tibia with polydactyly in the feet and hands. Since the tibia may be late in ossifying, it is not certain that this trait is different from that listed as tibia, absence of, with polydactyly. The fibula in these cases was thickened. Yujnovsky et al. (1974) reported a family with patients in 3 generations. The full-blown syndrome was present in only 1 case. They suggested that triphalangeal thumb is an especially consistent feature. Syndactyly was also a feature in the hands. The grandfather in the family reported by Eaton and McKusick (1969) lacked the tibial feature of the syndrome. Canki (1977) described mother and daughter with postaxial polydactyly, hypoplasia of the tibia, and unusually depressed nasal tip due apparently to hypoplasia of the major alar cartilages. Canun et al. (1984) described a kindred in which manifestation of the trait could be identified in members of 4 generations and by implication in a fifth. Bilateral absence of the tibia was the most severe manifestation. Prenatal diagnosis of a normal fetus (tibias normal) was made at gestational age 20.5 weeks. Canun (1986) provided further information indicating reduced penetrance: a clinically and radiologically normal male of the kindred they studied, married to an unrelated female, sired a girl with the most severe manifestations (absent tibiae, triphalangeal thumbs, and polydactyly). Cordeiro et al. (1986) reported a case with possible occurrence of the disorder in males in 3 successive generations. They referred to the condition as Werner syndrome, an undesirable designation because of the confusion with another disorder.</p>

<p>Werner (1915) reported the case of a 21-year-old woman with polydactyly of the hands, digitalization of the thumb, short lower limbs with aplasia of the tibias, and polydactyly of the toes. Davidson (1918) described a second isolated case. Reber (1968) described the first familial case in a boy with the full picture whose father had triphalangeal thumbs only. Vargas et al. (1995) described a family with 10 affected members in 3 generations. They found reports of about a dozen families. The hand is characterized by 5 triphalangeal digits in which the thumb is nonopposable, similar to the type thought to result from duplication of the index finger in association with agenesis of the normal thumb. Supportive of this hypothesis was the presence of an extra distal triradius at the base of the triphalangeal thumb of almost all affected persons in this family. Absence of the tibias was associated with duplication of the fibulas in the propositus but not in other affected members. The findings in the propositus were similar to those described by Laurin et al. (1964) (see) and Pfeiffer and Roeskau (1971). Temtamy and McKusick (1978) did not consider fibular dimelia a part of the phenotypic spectrum of the syndrome discussed here.</p>

<p>Al-Awadi et al. (1987) described a 5-year-old boy who had hyperplastic bowed tibias and postaxial polysyndactyly. The parents were first cousins. The father and 4 relatives had postaxial polysyndactyly. A sister had polysyndactyly. The mother had only cutaneous syndactyly, but her grandfather had polysyndactyly and another relative of hers had either syndactyly or polysyndactyly. Richieri-Costa et al. (1990) described what appears to be the same disorder in 3 members of a Brazilian family. Radioulnar synostosis was present in 2 of the 3 patients.</p>

<p>Agarwal et al. (1996) described a kindred with 7 affected individuals in 3 generations showing bilateral 5-fingered hands, pedal polydactyly with syndactyly, and agenesis of the tibia and distal end of the radius. There was no incidence of male-to-male transmission.</p>

<p>Kantaputra and Chalidapong (2000) reported a Thai man with triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome whose daughter had tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome. The authors proposed that these conditions are actually the same disorder with wide variability. They suggested that this condition be called 'tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumbs syndrome.'</p>

<p>Goldenberg et al. (2003) reported a Yugoslavian patient born with severe limb malformations characterized by absent thumbs, 5 triphalangeal digits, preaxial polydactyly of the hands, short lower legs due to tibial hypoplasia on 1 side and absent tibia on the other side, clubfeet, and preaxial polysyndactyly of the feet. He also had bilateral cryptorchidism and Hirschsprung disease. High-resolution cytogenetic studies were normal, excluding a contiguous gene syndrome. Clinical and radiographic studies of the parents were normal. Goldenberg et al. (2003) noted that Hall (1981) had reported Hirschsprung disease in a patient with hypoplasia of the tibia and polydactyly.</p>
