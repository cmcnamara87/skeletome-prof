<p>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that familial expansile osteolysis can be caused by mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene, encoding RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B), which is essential in osteoclast formation.</p>

<p>Wallace (1988) and Osterberg et al. (1988) described 40 members of a family with an autosomal dominant bone dysplasia which, while exhibiting some histologic similarity to Paget disease, is distinct enough in its features and natural history to be recognized as unique. Focal skeletal changes, with a predominantly peripheral distribution, had their onset in the second decade. Progressive osteoclastic resorption accompanied by medullary expansion led to severe, painful, disabling deformity and a tendency to pathologic fracture. Most affected persons had an associated early onset deafness and loss of dentition as a result of unique middle ear and jaw abnormalities. Wallace et al. (1989) indicated that 42 members of 5 generations of the northern Ireland family were affected. Barr et al. (1989) pictured the progressive changes over a 17-year period in a member of the family reported by Osterberg et al. (1988). Many patients in the family had suffered pathologic fractures, severe bone pain, and eventually major limb amputations. Most affected persons had deafness that initially was conductive but later might become mixed conductive and sensorineural in type. The onset of deafness was usually before the age of 10 years. There were also dental abnormalities with bizarre and extensive resorption of the cervical region of the teeth and the root apex. Dickson et al. (1991) used the designation familial expansile osteolysis (FEO). Some of the histologic features resemble those of Paget disease. FEO is often associated with early-onset middle ear deafness and premature loss of dentition. Unlike Paget disease, the focal skeletal lesions are characteristically found in the appendicular skeleton. Patients usually present in the second decade with bone pain and deformity. There is an increased risk of fracture. Dickson et al. (1991) demonstrated focal concentrations of multinuclear osteoclasts which contained viral-like microcylindrical inclusions in their nuclei. Serologic studies did not show any significant difference between viral antibody titers of patients and their age- and sex-matched controls. Dickson et al. (1991) suggested that intranuclear viral-like microcylindrical inclusions of osteoclasts are not a specific feature of Paget disease as has been proposed, but are found in other disorders of osteoclast dysfunction including pycnodysostosis, osteopetrosis, and giant cell tumors. Hughes et al. (1994) mapped the EOF gene to 18q21.1-q22 by linkage to DNA markers. A YAC contig of the region is also available and the gene is considered to lie between the microsatellite markers D18S64 and D18S51. The distance between these markers is 7-15 cM and a maximum lod score of 11.5 was obtained at a recombination value of 0 for D18S64. A homologous condition in the mouse is also caused by mutation in mouse chromosome 18 in an area homologous to human 18q.</p>

<p>Hughes et al. (2000) noted that the critical region to which FEO was mapped contains the gene encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-B (RANK), TNFRSF11A. RANK is essential in osteoclast formation. They proceeded to identify 2 different heterozygous insertion mutations in exon 1 of the TNFRSF11A gene in affected members of 4 families with FEO or familial Paget disease of bone (PDB;). A duplication of 18 bases (<a href="/entry/603499#0001">603499.0001</a>) was found to cause FEO. Both mutations affected the signal peptide region of the RANK molecule. Expression of recombinant forms of the mutant RANK proteins revealed perturbations in expression levels and lack of normal cleavage of the signal peptide. Both mutations caused an increase in RANK-mediated nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappa-B;) signaling in vitro, consistent with the presence of an activating mutation.</p>
