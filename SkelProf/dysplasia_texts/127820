<p>Hensinger et al. (1974) described a kindred in which 7 members in 2 generations in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance had dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica, intracapsular or periarticular chondromas of the knee, extraskeletal chondromas, and osteochondromas in various combinations. None of these individually has a known mendelian basis. Under the designation of dominant carpotarsal osteochondromatosis, Maroteaux et al. (1993) described a mother and son with what appeared to be the same condition as that in the family reported by Hensinger et al. (1974). The son was first seen at the age of 16 years for swelling and restricted mobility of the left ankle. About one year later he presented with swelling on the palmar surface of the right wrist and complained of limited flexion of the right knee with one episode of locking. The mother had first noted deformity of her right wrist in adolescence. At the age of 52 years, a swelling could be palpated on the palmar side of the left wrist. These had been demonstrated by x-rays taken at the age of 33 years. Maroteaux et al. (1993) suggested that this, in fact, is a condition distinct from dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica, which is usually sporadic. Genetic counseling is clearly quite different.</p>
