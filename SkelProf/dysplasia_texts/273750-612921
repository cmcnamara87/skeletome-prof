<p>Disease characteristics. 3-M syndrome is characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation (final height 5-6 SD below the mean; i.e., 120-130 cm), characteristic facies, and normal intelligence. Additional features of 3-M syndrome include short broad neck, prominent trapezii, deformed sternum, short thorax, square shoulders, winged scapulae, hyperlordosis, short fifth fingers, prominent heels, and loose joints. Males with 3-M syndrome have hypogonadism and, occasionally, hypospadias.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of 3-M syndrome is suggested in children with a low birth weight, severe growth retardation, characteristic facies (relatively large head, triangular face, hypoplastic midface, full eyebrows, fleshy nose tip, long philtrum, prominent mouth and lips, pointed chin) and characteristic radiologic findings (slender long bones with diaphyseal constriction and flared metaphyses, tall vertebral bodies that become foreshortened over time, anterior wedging of thoracic vertebral bodies, irregular upper and lower endplates, thoracic kyphoscoliosis, spina bifida occulta, small pelvic bones, small iliac wings, broad thorax with slender and horizontal ribs, and slightly delayed bone age). Two genes are now known to be associated with 3-M syndrome: CUL7 and OBSL1. Molecular genetic testing is available clinically for CUL7 and OBSL1 mutations.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Surgical bone lengthening may be an option. Adaptive aids for people with short stature are appropriate. Significant joint laxity should prompt orthopedic evaluation and measures to control the development of arthritis. Males with 3-M syndrome should be referred for endocrinologic evaluation regarding gonadal function at puberty.</p>

<p>Surveillance: monitoring of growth every 6-12 months on standard growth charts, with special attention to growth velocity.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. 3-M syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of a proband with 3-M syndrome has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing and prenatal testing are available for families in which the CUL7 or OBSL1 disease-causing mutations have been identified in an affected family member. Prenatal ultrasound examination reveals slowing of growth of all long bones.</p>
