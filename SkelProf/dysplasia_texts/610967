<p>Osteogenesis imperfecta is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility and low bone mass. Due to considerable phenotypic variability, Sillence et al. (1979) developed a classification of OI subtypes based on clinical features and disease severity: OI type I, with blue sclerae; perinatal lethal OI type II, also known as congenital OI; OI type III, a progressively deforming form with normal sclerae; and OI type IV, with normal sclerae. Most forms of OI are autosomal dominant with mutations in one of the 2 genes that code for type I collagen alpha chains, COL1A1 and COL1A2. Glorieux et al. (2000) described a novel autosomal dominant form of OI, which they designated OI type V, in 7 patients. The disorder was similar to OI type IV but had distinctive clinical, histologic, and molecular characteristics.</p>
