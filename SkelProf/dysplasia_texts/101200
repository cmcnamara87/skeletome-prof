<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized primarily by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and syndactyly of the hands and feet with a tendency to fusion of bony structures. Most cases are sporadic, but autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported (Mantilla-Capacho et al., 2005).</p>

<p>Cohen (1973) provided a review of all the 'craniosynostosis syndromes.'</p>
