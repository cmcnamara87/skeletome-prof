<p>Disease characteristics. SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasias include sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease; both are disorders of osteoblast hyperactivity. The major clinical features of sclerosteosis are progressive skeletal overgrowth and variable syndactyly, usually of the second (index) and third (middle) fingers. Affected individuals appear normal at birth except for syndactyly. Distinctive facial features including asymmetric mandibular hypertrophy, frontal bossing, and midface hypoplasia are usually apparent by mid-childhood. Hyperostosis of the skull results in narrowing of the foramina, causing entrapment of the seventh cranial nerve often leading to facial palsy, and entrapment of the eighth cranial nerve, often resulting in deafness in mid-childhood. In sclerosteosis, hyperostosis of the calvarium reduces intracranial volume, increasing the risk for potentially lethal elevation of intracranial pressure in adulthood. Survival of individuals with sclerosteosis into old age is unusual. The manifestations of van Buchem disease are generally milder than sclerosteosis and syndactyly is absent.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing.  The diagnoses of sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease are based upon recognition of the characteristic clinical and radiographic features. Radiographic findings include widening (hyperostosis) and increased density (sclerosis) of the calvarium, the base of the skull, and the shafts of the tubular bones. SOST is the only gene known to be associated with sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease. Molecular genetic testing is available on a clinical basis.</p>

<p>Management.  Treatment of manifestations: surgical decompression of entrapped cranial nerves; craniectomy for increased intracranial pressure; middle ear surgery for conductive hearing loss; hearing aids; spinal cord decompression for backache; surgical correction of syndactyly; surgical reduction of mandibular overgrowth. Prevention of Secondary Complications: Tooth extraction may be difficult; management by an orthodontic or craniofacial team is recommended. Surveillance: annual assessments from infancy for hearing, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, and evidence of nerve entrapment. Testing of relatives at risk: clinical appraisal, lateral skull radiograph if indicated.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling.  The SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasias are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of a proband has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at 25% risk is possible if both mutant alleles have been identified in an affected family member or if linkage has been established. Ultrasound examination may detect syndactyly, but its absence on ultrasound examination is not indicative of an unaffected fetus.</p>
