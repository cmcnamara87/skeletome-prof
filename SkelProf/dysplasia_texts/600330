<p>Majewski et al. (1993) suggested that a disorder they referred to as serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome is distinct from Melnick-Needles syndrome. Dereymaeker et al. (1986) described 3 female patients with features of Melnick-Needles syndrome. Their patient 1 differed from the other patients by elongation and S-shape ('serpentine'-shape) of the fibulas, suggesting heterogeneity. Exner (1988) observed a 5-year-old girl with small stature, unusual facial appearance, normal intelligence, polycystic kidneys, and S-shaped and elongated fibulas. He noted the striking similarities to patient 1 of Dereymaeker et al. (1986) and postulated a hitherto unrecognized syndrome different from Melnick-Needles syndrome. Majewski et al. (1993) reported a 9.5-year-old girl who showed proportionate short stature, large skull with an occipital depression, shield chest with mild pectus excavatum and wide intermamillary distance, hirsutism, short neck, bowed forearms and lower legs due to bowed radii and elongated serpentine fibulas, and metatarsus adductus. Two of the 3 reported patients, including the patient of Majewski et al. (1993), were deaf. For comparison and contrast, Majewski et al. (1993) also reported a girl with Melnick-Needles syndrome. Chromosomes were normal. The photographs of the patient with serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome showed an appearance suggesting Turner syndrome with low-set ears and short neck. The mode of inheritance of SFPKS is completely unclear. Since all reported cases have been female, it may an X-linked dominant with lethality in the hemizygous affected male, as has been suggested for Melnick-Needles syndrome. Indeed, it is possible that these are allelic disorders.</p>

<p>Rosser et al. (1996) reported 3 sibs with similar manifestations in a family from England. Serpentine fibula, full cheeks, prominent eyes, megalocornea, ptosis, micrognathia, joint laxity, sensorineural deafness, hypoplastic terminal phalanges of the 2nd and 5th fingers, atrial septal defect (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; see), and intestinal malrotation were found in the female proband. Her older brother, who died at the age of 8 months, also had micrognathia, full cheeks, megalocornea, and ASD. In addition, he had wide metopic suture, coloboma of the iris, ventricular septal defect, small penis, inguinal hernia, and hypospadias. His karyotype was 47,XXY. Another brother, who died at the age of 15 weeks, had full cheeks, micrognathia, hypoplasia and bowing of the upper parts of both radii and ulnae, PDA, intestinal malrotation, umbilical hernia, and cystic kidneys. Although it is evident that all 3 sibs had various manifestations of the same syndrome, serpentine fibula was found only in the female proband. Because serpentine fibula is not a mandatory manifestation of this syndrome, some other reports from the literature (ter Haar et al., 1982; Hamel et al., 1995) may actually describe the same syndrome. Occurrence of this complex in 3 sibs of different sex suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of the syndrome (Rosser et al., 1996). Maas et al. (2004) concluded that the cases of Rosser et al. (1996) probably represented the same entity that they referred to as the Frank-ter Haar syndrome.</p>

<p>Kaplan et al. (1995) described cystic kidney disease in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome and suggested that SFPKS and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome are fundamentally the same disorder. Fryns et al. (1997) described the case of a 36-year-old man with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome in whom end-stage renal failure due to cystic kidney disease was diagnosed at the age of 14 years and treated with dialysis and kidney transplantation.</p>
