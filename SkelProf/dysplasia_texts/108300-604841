<p>Disease characteristics. Stickler syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that can include ocular findings of myopia, cataract, and retinal detachment; hearing loss that is both conductive and sensorineural; midfacial underdevelopment and cleft palate (either alone or as part of the Robin sequence); and mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and/or precocious arthritis. Variable phenotypic expression of Stickler syndrome occurs both within families and among families; interfamilial variability is in part explained by locus and allelic heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of Stickler syndrome is clinically based. At present, no consensus minimal clinical diagnostic criteria exist. Mutations affecting one of four genes (COL2A1, COL9A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2) have been associated with Stickler syndrome; because a few families with features of Stickler syndrome are not linked to any of these four loci, mutations in other genes may also cause the disorder. Molecular genetic testing for COL2A1, COL9A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2 is available in clinical laboratories.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Management in a comprehensive craniofacial clinic when possible; tracheostomy as needed in infants with Robin sequence; mandibular advancement procedure to correct malocclusion for those with persistent micrognathia; correction of refractive errors with spectacles; standard treatment of retinal detachment and sensorineural and conductive hearing loss; symptomatic treatment for arthropathy.</p>

<p>Prevention of secondary complications: Antibiotic prophylaxis for mitral valve prolapse in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Annual examination by a vitreoretinal specialist; audiologic evaluations every six months through age five years, then annually thereafter; screening for MVP on routine physical examination.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities such as contact sports that may lead to traumatic retinal detachment.</p>

<p>Testing of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to determine which family members at risk have Stickler syndrome and, hence, warrant ongoing surveillance.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Stickler syndrome caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; Stickler syndrome caused by mutations in COL9A1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In families with autosomal dominant inheritance, affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to each offspring. In families with autosomal recessive inheritance, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing is possible in pregnancies at increased risk if the disease-causing mutation(s) in the family is (are) known.</p>
