<p>Larsen syndrome is an osteochondrodysplasia characterized by large-joint dislocations and characteristic craniofacial abnormalities. The cardinal features of the condition are dislocations of the hip, knee and elbow joints, with equinovarus or equinovalgus foot deformities. Spatula-shaped fingers, most marked in the thumb, are also present. Craniofacial anomalies include hypertelorism, prominence of the forehead, a depressed nasal bridge, and a flattened midface. Cleft palate and short stature are often associated features. Spinal anomalies include scoliosis and cervical kyphosis. Hearing loss is a well-recognized complication (summary by Bicknell et al., 2007).</p>
