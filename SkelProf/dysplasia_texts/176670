<p>Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by short stature, low body weight, early loss of hair, lipodystrophy, scleroderma, decreased joint mobility, osteolysis, and facial features that resemble aged persons. Cardiovascular compromise leads to early death. Cognitive development is normal. Onset is usually within the first year of life (review by Hennekam, 2006). The designation Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome appears to have been first used by DeBusk (1972).</p>

<p>A subset of patients with heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene and a phenotype similar to HGPS have shown onset of the disorder in late childhood or in the early teenage years, and have longer survival than observed in classic HGPS (Chen et al., 2003; Hegele, 2003).</p>

<p>Other disorders with a less severe, but overlapping phenotype include mandibular acral dysplasia (MADA;), an autosomal disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene, dilated cardiomyopathy with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, caused by heterozygous mutation in the LMNA gene, and Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RECQL2 gene.</p>
