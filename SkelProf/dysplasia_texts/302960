<p>Disease characteristics. The findings in X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2) range from fetal demise with multiple malformations and severe growth retardation to much milder manifestations, including adults with no recognizable physical abnormalities. At least 95% of liveborn individuals with CDPX2 are female with the following findings: growth deficiency/short stature; distinctive craniofacial appearance; skeletal changes (stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] on x-rays of the epiphyses of the long bones and vertebrae, the trachea and distal ends of the ribs seen in children prior to completion of normal epiphyseal ossification; rhizomelic [i.e., proximal] shortening of limbs that is often asymmetric; scoliosis); ectodermal changes (linear or blotchy scaling ichthyosis in the newborn that usually resolves in the first months of life leaving linear or whorled atrophic patches involving hair follicles (follicular atrophoderma); coarse hair with scarring alopecia; occasional flattened or split nails; normal teeth); and ocular changes (cataracts; microphthalmia and/or microcornea). Intellect is usually normal. Rarely affected males have been identified with a phenotype that includes: hypotonia; moderate to profound developmental delay; seizures; cerebellar (primarily vermis) hypoplasia and/or Dandy Walker variant; and agenesis of the corpus callosum.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of CDPX2 rests on the presence of clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis and sterol analysis of plasma, scales from skin lesions, or cultured lymphoblasts or fibroblasts showing increased concentration of 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol. Often a confirmatory mutation is identified in EBP, the only gene in which mutations are known to cause CDPX2.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and individualized. For females with typical CDPX2 diagnosed in the newborn period, the following are appropriate: orthopedic management of leg length discrepancy; frequent assessment of kyphoscoliosis; cataract extraction and correction of vision; dermatologic management of skin lesions; sun protection; physical, occupational, and speech therapies, if necessary; standard interventions for congenital heart defects, kidney anomalies, and hearing loss.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Regular follow-up of ophthalmologic abnormalities; regular orthopedic evaluations to monitor kyphoscoliosis, joint problems, and any leg length discrepancy. Routine developmental assessments, hearing evaluations, follow-up with a dermatologist, and monitoring of existing cardiac and/or renal abnormalities.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. CDPX2 is inherited in an X-linked manner with early gestational male lethality. Women with an EBP germline mutation have a 50% chance of transmitting the disease-causing mutation to each child: EBP mutations in sons are usually lethal; daughters will have a range of possible phenotypic expression. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low but greater than that of the general population. If the disease-causing mutation cannot be detected in the DNA extracted from the leukocytes of either parent of the proband, three possible explanations are germline mosaicism, somatic mosaicism, or a de novo mutation in the proband. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the family-specific disease-causing mutation is known.</p>
