<p>Liebenberg (1973) described 4 males and 6 females in 5 generations of a white South African family with upper limb deformities affecting the fingers, wrists and elbows. Male-to-male transmission suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. Affected members had dysplasia of all bony components of the elbow causing flexion deformity and an appearance resembling anterior dislocation. At the wrist, anomalies were triquetro-pisiform fusion, small capitate, trapezium and trapezoid, enlarged triquetrum and hamate, and slight flexion and radial deviation. The fingers had short, club-shaped distal phalanges and small, grooved nails. One affected member had bilateral fifth finger camptodactyly (streblomicrodactyly). There were no other bony fusions, tarsal coalition or clubfeet, thus differentiating this disorder from others characterized by carpal synostosis with more extensive bony fusions (see and). The disorder is also distinct from Banki syndrome which is characterized by lunatotriquetral fusion, brachymetacarpy, and leptometacarpy with normal elbows. Liebenberg (1973) examined 5 of the 6 living affected members of this kindred. Beighton (1985) reexamined the family with identification of additional affected persons and corroboration of the distinctive phenotype.</p>

<p>Tiberio et al. (2000) described a mother and 2 sons with clinical and radiologic features closely resembling those described by Liebenberg (1973). The bony components of the elbow joints were enlarged and poorly modeled. All 3 patients had a large triquetrum and camptodactyly of the fifth fingers. None of the patients in this family, however, had the triquetopisiform fusion described by Liebenberg (1973), although the children described were too young to have developed the ossification center of the pisiform. Triquetopisiform fusion was not seen in the mother; the fusion was between the scaphoid and lunate. All 3 affected individuals had 10% flexion at the elbows in the anatomic position, with radial deviation of wrist joints. Pronosupination was limited. In addition to camptodactyly, there was brachydactyly of all fingers. The 2 affected children and their mother were of normal intelligence, with normal growth parameters and good general health. Tiberio et al. (2000) suggested that Liebenberg syndrome might be due to mutations in the NOG gene.</p>
