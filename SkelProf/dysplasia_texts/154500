<p>Treacher Collins syndrome is a disorder of craniofacial development. The features include antimongoloid slant of the eyes, coloboma of the lid, micrognathia, microtia and other deformity of the ears, hypoplastic zygomatic arches, and macrostomia. Conductive hearing loss and cleft palate are often present (Dixon, 1996).</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity of Treacher Collins Syndrome</p>

<p>Treacher Collins syndrome-2 (TCS2;) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the POLR1D gene on chromosome 13q12.2. Treacher Collins syndrome-3 (TCS3;) is caused by compound heterozygous mutation in the POLR1C gene on chromosome 6.</p>
