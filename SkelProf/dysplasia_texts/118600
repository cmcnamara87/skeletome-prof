<p>Familial articular chondrocalcinosis is a chronic articular disease characterized by acute intermittent attacks of arthritis; the presence of calcium hypophosphate crystals in synovial fluid, cartilage and periarticular soft tissue; and, by x-ray, evidence of calcium deposition in articular cartilage. Chondrocalcinosis occurs in 3 forms: a hereditary form; a form associated with metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism and Wilson disease; and a sporadic form, which may in some cases represent the hereditary form. Under the designation of chondrocalcinosis articularis, Aschoff et al. (1966) described a family with 4 affected persons in 2 generations. The disorder was manifested clinically by episodic inflammatory involvement, acute or subacute, of one or more joints. Calcified hyaline and fibrous cartilage is demonstrable by x-ray, particularly in large joints. In articular cartilage a dense narrow band follows the contour of the epiphysis. Reginato et al. (1970) observed an unusually high frequency among natives of the Chiloe Island group. Twenty-eight patients were observed of whom 19 were aggregated in 6 kindreds. Parent-child involvement with no male-to-male transmission was observed in 3 of the families. In the other 3 families one or both parents were not screened. Since the Chiloe group lives in an isolated area and is presumably inbred, recessive inheritance remains a possibility. In these cases involvement was polyarticular. Ankylosing of joints was a new feature observed in this study. Rodriguez-Valverde et al. (1980) studied the first-degree relatives of 46 cases in northern Spain and found that 5 cases were familial. In these 5 families, a total of 17 persons showed calcified cartilage radiographically. All were in the same generation, although not always in the same sibship. Inbreeding (type unspecified) was stated for 4 of the 5 kindreds. In a further study, Rodriguez-Valverde et al. (1988) identified 13 pedigrees through a systematic radiologic survey of the first-degree relatives of 76 probands. Thirty women and 11 men in 25 sibships were affected. The disease was of early onset in only 4 pedigrees. The clinical manifestations in these 4 pedigrees were similar to those found in the kindreds with late onset. Autosomal dominant inheritance was supported. In Spain, Fernandez Dapica and Gomez-Reino (1986) found a 28.1% prevalence of chondrocalcinosis in 149 relatives of 32 patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPDD) disease. No clinical or radiologic differences between sporadic and familial cases were found. The features were similar to those of the Chiloe islanders with familial chondrocalcinosis as reported by Reginato (1976). Fernandez Dapica and Gomez-Reino (1986) concluded that the findings support the idea that the disorder was carried to Chile by Spanish immigrants. In a study of 35 patients with chondrocalcinosis in Spain, Balsa et al. (1990) found a prevalence of familial disease of 26%. They suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and more severe involvement in homozygotes.</p>

<p>Depressed activity of synovial pyrophosphohydrolase was suggested by the findings of Good and Starkweather (1969). This was not pursued further (Good, 1974). Autosomal dominant inheritance for a form of chondrocalcinosis is strongly supported by the pedigree reported by van der Korst et al. (1974). Father-to-son transmission was noted. Twenty-two cases in 2 generations were observed. Acute attacks occurred in only 14 of the 22 and 6 of the 14 had not yet sought medical care. Gaudreau et al. (1981) described articular chondrocalcinosis in 9 persons in 3 generations of a Quebec family (presumably French Canadian). Extensive calcification of the cartilage of the pinnae and of intervertebral discs was demonstrated. In 12 affected members of a single kindred (Gaucher et al., 1977), Lust et al. (1981) found that cultured fibroblasts and lymphocytes had a concentration of intracellular inorganic pyrophosphate 2 times greater than that in cells from unaffected family members and normal, unrelated volunteers. Bjelle et al. (1982) studied 2 extensive, affected Swedish kindreds that supported autosomal dominant inheritance. Of persons over 50 years of age, 47% had experienced acute attacks of arthritis and/or had joint calcifications. Back pain was frequent, but no ankylosis or deformity was observed. As compared with 50 sporadic cases observed in the same area of Sweden, the familial cases had an earlier onset, a greater number of involved joints, and more frequent peripheral joint involvement. Back pain was more frequent, and calcification of intervertebral discs was found only in the hereditary cases. Bjelle et al. (1982) demonstrated a genealogic link between 3 Swedish families, thus showing probable founder effect similar to that found in Slovakia, France, and Chile. No connection to other European families was found. In an Ashkenazi Jewish kindred, Eshel et al. (1990) found 7 members with a medical history of this disorder and in the most recent generations 5 members with direct evidence of the disorder. Symptoms started in the third decade and radiologic evidence developed by the fourth decade. The joints commonly affected were knees, wrists, and elbows. The course was chronic with acute, exercise-induced exacerbations.</p>
