<p>Bartlett and Kishore (1976) described multiple hyperostotic or osteosclerotic lesions of the calvaria in a man and 3 of his sons, each by a different mother. Two other sons and a daughter were presumed unaffected. The authors mistakenly interpreted the genetics as 'incompletely dominant sex-linked.'</p>

<p>Baumgartner et al. (2001) reported the sporadic case of a 16-year-old patient with this rare autosomal disorder. They emphasized that many pathologic fractures, lumps on the head, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and dental caries are the main characteristics of the disorder. Their patient had had 10 pathologic factors between age 6 weeks and 15 years. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase was found at age 11 and skull lumps at age 15. Radiography showed frontal and parietal round radiolucencies surrounded by sclerotic bone resembling doughnuts. Because the findings were reminiscent of osteogenesis imperfecta (see), collagen types I, III, and V were analyzed in fibroblasts and shown to be normal. They found that MRI of the skull could detect skull lesions at an early stage, even before palpable lesions appeared.</p>
