<p>Disease characteristics. Cherubism is characterized by progressive, painless, bilateral enlargement of the mandible and/or maxilla resulting from replacement of bone with multilocular cysts composed of fibrotic stromal cells and osteoclast-like cells. The enlargement is usually symmetric in nature. The phenotype ranges from no clinical manifestations to severe mandibular and maxillary overgrowth with respiratory, vision, speech, and swallowing problems. Onset is typically between ages two and five years. Other bones are usually not affected and the affected person is otherwise normal. The jaw lesions progress slowly until puberty when they stabilize and then regress. Dental abnormalities include congenitally missing teeth, premature exfoliation of the deciduous teeth, and displacement of permanent teeth by the jaw lesions. By age 30 years, facial abnormalities are no longer apparent; residual jaw deformity is rare.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis depends on typical clinical findings and radiographic findings of well-defined, often extensive bilateral multilocular areas of diminished density in the mandible and/or maxilla. Molecular genetic testing of SH3BP2, the only gene in which mutation is currently known to cause cherubism, is clinically available. Sequence analysis of exon 9 is typically performed first as most missense mutations identified to date are in exon 9.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Care by a craniofacial team in a major pediatric medical center; surgery (curettage with or without bone grafting) as needed between ages five to 15 years for disfiguring enlargement of jaws or locally aggressive lesions; orthodontic treatment; ophthalmologic treatment for displacement of the globe or vision loss.</p>

<p>Prevention of secondary complications: Early orthodontia and/or jaw reconstruction may reduce risk for upper airway obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea, and tooth displacement.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Long-term follow-up with clinical, radiographic, dental, orthodontic, and ophthalmologic evaluations.</p>

<p>Testing of relatives at risk: When the disease-causing mutation in the family is known, molecular testing can be used to identify mildly affected relatives who may benefit from early intervention; otherwise, clinical and radiographic evaluations can identify relatives at risk.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Cherubism is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown because of variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. Each child of an individual with cherubism has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible when the SH3BP2 disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family.</p>
