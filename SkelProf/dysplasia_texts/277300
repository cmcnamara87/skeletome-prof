<p>The spondylocostal dysostoses are a heterogeneous group of axial skeletal disorders characterized by multiple segmentation defects of the vertebrae (SDV), malalignment of the ribs with variable points of intercostal fusion, and often a reduction in rib number. The term 'spondylocostal dysostosis' is best applied to those phenotypes with generalized SDV and a broadly symmetric thoracic cage (summary by Gucev et al., 2010).</p>

<p>Genetic Heterogeneity</p>

<p>Other forms of autosomal recessive SCDO include SCDO2, caused by mutation in the MESP2 gene on chromosome 15q26.1; SCDO3, caused by mutation the LFNG gene on chromosome 7p22, and SCDO4, caused by mutation in the HES7 gene on chromosome 17p13.2.</p>

<p>An autosomal dominant form of SCDO has also been described (SCDO5;).</p>
