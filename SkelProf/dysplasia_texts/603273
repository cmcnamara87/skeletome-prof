                                    Yang et al. (1998) described the cloning of tumor protein p63, which shows strong homology to the tumor suppressor p53 and the p53-related protein p73. p63 was detected in a variety of human and mouse tissues, including proliferating basal cells of epithelial layers in the epidermis, cervix, urothelium, and prostate. Unlike p53, the p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. The predominant p63 isoforms in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. The full-length p63 protein contains 448 amino acids. Isoforms of p63 are due to alternative promoters in exons 1 or 3 and alternative splicing of exons at the 3-prime end. These truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63. Yang et al. (1998) suggested the possibility of physiologic interactions among members of the p53 family.</p>

<p>Augustin et al. (1998) also cloned a cDNA, which they termed KET, that is related to the tumor suppressor p53. They stated that the 4,846-bp KET cDNA encodes a protein of 680 amino acids that shares 98% identity with the rat homolog. The remarkable degree of conservation lent support to the notion that KET proteins have important basic functions in development and differentiation.</p>

<p>Di Iorio et al. (2005) stated that the p63 gene generates 6 isoforms. The transactivating isoforms are generated by the activity of an upstream promoter, and the N-terminally truncated (delta-N) isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, are produced from a downstream intronic promoter. For both transcripts, alternative splicing gives rise to 3 different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma.</p>

<p>Deutsch et al. (2011) stated that full-length TAp63-alpha contains an N-terminal transactivation domain, followed by a DNA-binding domain, an oligomerization domain, a sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domain, and a C-terminal transactivation inhibitory (TI) domain.</p>
