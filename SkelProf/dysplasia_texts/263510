<p>The short rib-polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) are a group of autosomal recessive lethal skeletal dysplasias characterized by markedly short ribs, short limbs, polydactyly, and multiple anomalies of major organs, including heart, intestines, genitalia, kidney, liver, and pancreas. Four types have been distinguished: SRPS I (Saldino-Noonan type;), SRPS II (Majewski type;), SRPS III (Verma-Naumoff type), and SRPS IV (Beemer-Langer type;). Significant phenotypic overlap has been reported in these forms (Elcioglu and Hall, 2002).</p>
