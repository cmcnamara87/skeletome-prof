<p>The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited disorders caused by a lack of specific lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), or mucopolysaccharides. The accumulation of partially degraded GAGs causes interference with cell, tissue, and organ function.</p>

<p>Deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase can result in a wide range of phenotypic involvement with 3 major recognized clinical entities: Hurler (MPS IH), Scheie (MPS IS;), and Hurler-Scheie (MPS IH/S;) syndromes. Hurler and Scheie syndromes represent phenotypes at the severe and mild ends of the MPS I clinical spectrum, respectively, and the Hurler-Scheie syndrome is intermediate in phenotypic expression (McKusick, 1972).</p>

<p>MPS I is more frequent than MPS II (Hunter syndrome;), which has no corneal clouding and pursues a slower course.</p>
