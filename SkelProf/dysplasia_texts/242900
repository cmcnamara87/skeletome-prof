<p>Disease characteristics. Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) resulting in disproportionate short stature, nephropathy, and T-cell deficiency. Radiographic manifestations of SED include ovoid and mildly flattened vertebral bodies, small deformed capital femoral epiphyses, and shallow dysplastic acetabular fossae. Adult height is 136-157 cm for men and 98.5-143 cm for women. Nearly all affected individuals have progressive steroid-resistant nephropathy, usually developing within five years of the diagnosis of growth failure and terminating with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The majority of tested individuals have T-cell deficiency and associated risk for opportunistic infection, a common cause of death. SIOD involves a spectrum that ranges from an infantile or severe early-onset form with death early in life to a juvenile or milder later-onset form with survival into adulthood if renal disease is appropriately treated.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. SIOD is diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings. SMARCAL1 is the only gene known to be associated with SIOD. Molecular genetic testing of SMARCAL1 is available clinically on a limited basis.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Hip replacement as needed in older individuals; renal transplantation as indicated; bone marrow transplantation as indicated; acyclovir for recurrent herpetic infections; imiquimod and cidofovir for severe disseminated cutaneous papilloma virus infections; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for neutropenia; agents that improve blood flow or decrease coagulability to treat transient ischemic attacks or strokes.</p>

<p>Prevention of secondary complications: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Regular monitoring of the hips; annual monitoring of renal, immune, and hematologic status.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. SIOD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the chance of his/her being a carrier is 2/3. Prenatal testing using molecular genetic techniques may be available through laboratories offering custom prenatal testing.</p>
