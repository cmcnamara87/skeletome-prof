<p>Disease characteristics. Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) involves a classic clinical tetrad of changes in the nails, knees, and elbows, and the presence of iliac horns. Nail changes are the most constant feature of NPS. Nails may be absent, hypoplastic, or dystrophic; ridged longitudinally or horizontally; pitted; discolored; separated into two halves by a longitudinal cleft or ridge of skin; and thin or (less often) thickened. The patellae may be small, irregularly shaped, or absent. Elbow abnormalities may include limitation of extension, pronation, and supination; cubitus valgus; and antecubital pterygia. Iliac horns are bilateral, conical, bony processes that project posteriorly and laterally from the central part of the iliac bones of the pelvis. Renal involvement, first manifest as proteinuria with or without hematuria, occurs in 30%-50% of affected individuals; end-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurs in about 5% of affected individuals. Primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension occur at increased frequency and at a younger age than in the general population.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of nail-patella syndrome is based on clinical findings. Molecular genetic testing of LMX1B, the only gene known to be associated with NPS, is available on a clinical basis.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Orthopedic problems may be helped by analgesics, physiotherapy, splinting, bracing, or surgery; ACE inhibitors to control blood pressure and possibly to slow progression of proteinuria; renal transplantation as needed.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Annual monitoring for hypertension and renal disease; screening for glaucoma as soon as a child is compliant.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Chronic use of NSAIDs because of the detrimental effect on kidney function.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Nail-patella syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Eighty-eight percent of individuals with NPS have an affected parent. Twelve percent of affected individuals have a de novo mutation. The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting NPS. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family has been identified.</p>
