<p>Shortening is limited to the middle phalanx of the fifth finger. Because of rhomboid or triangular shape of the rudimentary middle phalanx, radial curvature (clinodactyly) of the fifth finger results. (Camptodactyly is flexure contracture of fingers, usually the fifth. Clinodactyly, which also involves the fifth finger, is a radial curvature.) Dutta (1965) described 'simple radial deviation of the distal phalanx' without bony deformity of the middle or distal phalanx and with normal length of the digit. Whether this is a separate trait is not certain. Type A3 brachydactyly is variable and may encompass the cases described by Dutta. (See also dystelephalangy,.) Bauer (1907) described the anomaly in 4 generations. Defining shortened fifth medial phalanges as those less than half the length of the fourth medial phalanx, Hertzog (1967) found the state much more frequent in Chinese than in Blacks. Population surveys suggest that the trait is more frequent in Mongoloids and American Indians than in whites or Blacks. The condition is more frequent in females. (Note that brachymesophalangy V and brachytelophalangy I are 'normal' forms of brachydactyly and that each has characteristic sex and population distributions.) X-ray changes consist of cone-shaped epiphyses with early union.</p>
