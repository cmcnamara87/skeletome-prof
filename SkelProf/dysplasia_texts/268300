<p>Disease characteristics. Roberts syndrome (RBS) is characterized by prenatal growth retardation (ranging from mild to severe) and limb malformations (including bilateral symmetric tetraphocomelia or hypomelia caused by mesomelic shortening). Upper limbs are more severely affected than lower limbs. Other limb malformations include oligodactyly with thumb aplasia or hypoplasia, syndactyly, clinodactyly, and elbow and knee flexion contractures. Craniofacial abnormalities include cleft lip and/or cleft palate, premaxillary protrusion, micrognathia, microbrachycephaly, malar hypoplasia, downslanting palpebral fissures, ocular hypertelorism, exophthalmos resulting from shallow orbits, corneal clouding, hypoplastic nasal alae, beaked nose, and ear malformations. Intellectual disability is reported in the majority of affected individuals. Mortality is high among severely affected pregnancies and newborns. Mildly affected individuals may survive to adulthood.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of RBS relies on cytogenetic testing. Standard cytogenetic preparations stained with Giemsa or C-banding techniques show the characteristic chromosomal abnormality of premature centromere separation (PCS) and separation of the heterochromatic regions (also named heterochromatin repulsion, HR) in most chromosomes in all metaphases. ESCO2 is the only gene known to be associated with RBS. Molecular genetic testing is available.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Individualized treatment aimed to improve quality of life; surgery for cleft lip and/or palate, for correction of limb abnormalities, and to improve proper development of the prehensile hand grasp. Prostheses, speech assessment and therapy, aggressive treatment of otitis media, special education for developmental delays, and standard treatment for cardiac defects and renal abnormalities may be indicated.</p>

<p>Surveillance: Periodic follow-up of psychomotor development and physical growth; follow-up assessment of speech development and hearing if cleft lip and palate are present; screening for developmental delays or learning disorders; monitoring for specific ophthalmologic, cardiac, or renal anomalies.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. RBS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once an at-risk sib is known to be unaffected, the risk of his/her being a carrier is 2/3. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk may be possible by a combination of ultrasound examination combined with cytogenetic testing, or by molecular genetic testing if the mutations have been identified in the family.</p>
