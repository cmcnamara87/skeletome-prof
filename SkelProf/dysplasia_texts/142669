<p>Cilliers and Beighton (1990) identified a 'new' inherited skeletal disorder in 47 patients in 6 generations of an Afrikaner family in South Africa. Hip-joint discomfort usually developed during childhood at age less than 2 years, but might develop either later in childhood or, as in one instance, as late as the age of 35 years. After onset of symptoms, the hip joints deteriorated progressively, gait was disturbed, and, by early adulthood, affected individuals were crippled by degenerative arthropathy. General health was good, height was not significantly reduced, and there were no extra-skeletal manifestations. The major changes were in the femoral capital epiphyses, which were severely flattened and irregular. Secondary osteoarthrosis developed at an early age. One member of the kindred had severe kyphoscoliosis necessitating spinal fusion at an young age. By genealogic studies Cilliers and Beighton (1990) traced the family back to a single Dutch immigrant to South Africa who arrived in 1685. The pedigree showed a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with many instances of male-to-male transmission. Since only members of the Beukes family were identified as suffering from the condition, Cilliers and Beighton (1990) proposed the designation 'Beukes familial hip dysplasia (BFHD).'</p>

<p>Minor changes in the spine suggested to Beighton et al. (1994) that the disorder falls into the general nosologic category of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. In further studies of the Afrikaner family named Beukes, in which 47 members in 6 generations had premature osteoarthropathy of the hip joint, Beighton et al. (1994) excluded the type II collagen gene (COL2A1;) as the site of the mutation.</p>

<p>By linkage studies, Roby et al. (1999) found that the gene for the disorder, which they symbolized BHD, maps an 11-cM region on 4q35, in a region not occupied by other forms of autosomal dominant chondrodysplasia with associated osteoarthropathy such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, and pseudoachondroplasia. Thus, Beukes premature degenerative osteoarthropathy of the hip joint appears to be a unique entity.</p>

<p>In a stratification analysis of an osteoarthritis genome screen, Loughlin et al. (1999) found a suggestion of linkage centered on 4q12-q21.2 and restricted to female pairs with hip disease. Loughlin et al. (1999) considered it unlikely that this represented the same locus as that identified by Roby et al. (1999) at 4q35.</p>
