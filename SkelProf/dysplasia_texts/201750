<p>The Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) is an exceptionally rare craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by radiohumeral synostosis present from the perinatal period (summarized by McGlaughlin et al., 2010). There is a wide spectrum of anomalies seen in ABS; other features include midface hypoplasia, choanal stenosis or atresia, multiple joint contractures, visceral anomalies (particularly of the geniotourinary system), and impaired steroidogenesis (present only in patients with POR mutations). Mortality has been reported to be as high as 80% in the neonatal period, primarily due to airway compromise, and prognosis improves with increasing age.</p>
