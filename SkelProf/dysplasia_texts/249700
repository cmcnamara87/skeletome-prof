<p>Langer mesomelic dysplasia is characterized by severe limb aplasia or severe hypoplasia of the ulna and fibula, and a thickened and curved radius and tibia. These changes can result in displacement deformities of the hands and feet. Hypoplasia of the mandible is also observed (Langer, 1967).</p>

<p>See also Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, a less severe phenotype that results from heterozygous defect in the SHOX or SHOXY genes.</p>
