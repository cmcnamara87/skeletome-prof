<p>Disease characteristics. ROR2-related Robinow syndrome is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, skeletal abnormalities, and other anomalies. Craniofacial features include macrocephaly, broad prominent forehead, low-set ears, ocular hypertelorism, prominent eyes, midface hypoplasia, short upturned nose with depressed nasal bridge and flared nostrils, large and triangular mouth with exposed incisors and upper gums, gum hypertrophy, misaligned teeth, ankyloglossia, and micrognathia. Skeletal abnormalities include short stature with growth retardation, mesomelic or acromesomelic limb shortening, hemivertebrae with fusion of thoracic vertebrae, and brachydactyly. Other common features include micropenis with or without cryptorchidism in males and reduced clitoral size and hypoplasia of the labia majora in females, renal tract abnormalities, and nail hypoplasia or dystrophy. The disorder is recognizable at birth or in early childhood.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. ROR2-related Robinow syndrome is based on the presence of characteristic clinical findings. Molecular genetic testing of ROR2, the gene in which mutations cause autosomal recessive ROR2-related Robinow syndrome, is available in clinical diagnostic laboratories.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Corrective surgery for limb and spine defects and for facial abnormalities; orthodontic treatment as needed; surgery for scrotal transposition as needed; growth hormone therapy if growth hormone deficiency is diagnosed; human chorionic gonadotrophin and testosterone hormone therapy as needed for the treatment of micropenis.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. ROR2-related Robinow syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected with Robinow syndrome, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote (carrier) and usually asymptomatic, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations have been identified in the family.</p>
