<p>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, although variable in its expressivity, is characterized by rickets with bone deformities, short stature, dental anomalies, and at the biologic level, hypophosphatemia with low renal phosphate reabsorption, normal serum calcium level with hypocalciuria, normal or low serum level of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3, or calcitriol), normal serum level of PTH, and increased activity of serum alkaline phosphatases (summary by Gaucher et al., 2009).</p>
