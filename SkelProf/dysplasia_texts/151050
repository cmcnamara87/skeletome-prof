<p>Four unrelated patients were reported with a similar syndrome (Braham, 1969; Macpherson, 1974; Lenz and Majewski, 1974; Kaye et al., 1974; Robinow et al., 1977). The features were multiple congenital anomalies (delayed closure of fontanel, proximal symphalangism, prominent cutaneous veins), mental retardation, and progressive skeletal sclerosis with severe growth retardation. The patients had a progeroid appearance. The dental enamel was dysplastic. Skin hypoplasia and joint laxity suggested a connective tissue disorder. The sporadic occurrence and a somewhat advanced paternal age were consistent with dominant mutation. Choanal atresia is one of the anomalies.</p>

<p>Gorlin and Whitley (1983) reported a patient whose photograph showed strikingly loose and wrinkled atrophic skin of the hands with short digits and partial syndactyly. Scalp veins were prominent through thin, wrinkled, and atrophic skin. Breathing was accompanied by nasal 'snorting' due to marked bilateral narrowing of the nasal choanae, and nasolacrimal duct obstruction was present. Erupting teeth showed defective enamel. Radiologic features included progressive sclerosis of the skull, facial bones, and vertebrae; broad clavicles and ribs; short or absent middle phalanges; diaphyseal undermodeling and midshaft cortical thickening; and retarded skeletal maturation.</p>

<p>Chrzanowska et al. (1989) described a 10-year-old son of young, healthy, unrelated parents who had progeroid appearance; bilateral symmetrical shortening of the fingers and metacarpals, most pronounced in rays IV and V with soft tissue webbing of those fingers; short toes; marked sclerosis of the cranial base with thickening of the calvaria; loose, thin skin with marked hyperlaxity; hyperostosis of the iliac wings; bilateral humeroradial synostosis; and 'beginning' proximal symphalangism of fingers II and III bilaterally.</p>

<p>Majewski (2000) reported follow-up on the original patient with Lenz-Majewski syndrome reported by Lenz and Majewski (1974). At age 2.5 years, the patient had an enlarged anterior fontanel, an open metopic suture, and marked hypertelorism. There was macrostomia, deep root of the nose, high palate, short, yellow, carious teeth, and progeroid appearance. She had a short neck, broad clavicles, increased venous pattern of the forehead and thorax, decreased subcutaneous fat of the abdomen, and lumbar kyphoscoliosis. The forearms were short with limited elbow extension. The hands showed marked brachydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly, stiff finger joints, and hyperconvex nails. At age 9.5 years, she spoke a few single words and was toilet trained. Radiologic examination showed hip dysplasia, hyperostosis of the skull, and synostosis of the fourth and fifth metacarpals. Menarche occurred at age 19 years. At age 30 years, she was 120 cm tall and severely mentally handicapped. She had large, prominent eyes, marked hypertelorism, and divergent strabismus. The lips and tongue were thick, teeth were short, and mandible was enlarged. She had normal breast development, sparse subcutaneous fat, scant pubic hair, and absent axillary hair. The skin was weak and atrophic, and there were prominent veins. There was massive thickening of the long tubular bones, proximal synostosis of all metacarpals, proximal symphalangism of the fingers, marked kyphoscoliosis, and rectangular fibular deviation of the big toes. Majewski (2000) concluded that the hyperostosis and generalized osteosclerosis are progressive in Lenz-Majewski syndrome.</p>

<p>Saraiva (2000) reported the seventh case of Lenz-Majewski hyperostotic dwarfism in a 4-year-old Portuguese girl. In addition to most of the recognized manifestations of the syndrome, she had dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, mainly hypoplasia of the splenium but also of the genu, and mild hemispheric white matter atrophy. Both parents and 2 older sisters were phenotypically normal.</p>

<p>Wattanasirichaigoon et al. (2004) reported a sporadic case of Lenz-Majewski syndrome with newly recognized manifestations including facial palsy, cleft palate, and hydrocephalus developing later in infancy. Increased intracranial pressure was identified and treated early to prevent neurologic morbidity.</p>

<p>Dateki et al. (2007) reported a 17-year-old Japanese boy with a mild form of Lenz-Majewski syndrome. As a child, he had prominent veins in the scalp and abdominal wall, and later had delayed eruption of permanent teeth and enamel dysplasia. He had cutis laxa, a progeroid facial appearance with prognathism, wrinkled skin, large ears,  interdigital webbing, and mild mental retardation. Skeletal changes included calvarial hyperostosis, sclerosis of the skull base, an enlarged sclerotic mandible, broad clavicles and ribs, and diaphyseal undermodeling of the tubular bones. The patient was considered to have a mild variant of the disorder because he had normal height and muscular build and absence of brachymesophalangy with proximal symphalangism. The family history was unremarkable; at the boy's birth, his father was 30 years of age.</p>
