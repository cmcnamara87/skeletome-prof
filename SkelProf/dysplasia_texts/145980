<p>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that this phenotype is caused by mutation in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR;). Loss-of-function mutations in the CASR gene are responsible for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC1) and for neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT;). Gain-of-function mutations result in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.</p>

<p>From studies of the families of 25 index patients with primary parathyroid hyperplasia, Marx et al. (1977) identified 2 autosomal dominant disorders, type I multiple endocrine adenomatosis and one they termed familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. The latter was present in the families of 2 of the patients. Among offspring of affected persons in the kindreds with FHH, as distinct from MEA I, the prevalence of hypercalcemia approached the expected 50% during the first 2 decades. Nephrolithiasis and peptic ulcer were uncommon. Moderate hypercalcemia occurred without hypercalciuria. Subtotal parathyroidectomy did not abolish hypercalcemia. Concentrations of peptide hormones other than parathyroid hormones were common in patients with FHH.</p>

<p>Marx et al. (1978) and Marx et al. (1981) contrasted FHH with primary hyperparathyroidism (HP). Patients with FHH had higher creatinine clearance values than HP patients but higher serum magnesium levels than both normals and HP patients. Elevated magnesium level was proportional to elevated calcium level in FHH but was inversely related in HP. Urinary excretion of both calcium and magnesium was significantly lower in FHH than in HP. Abnormal serum protein binding of calcium and magnesium in FHH was excluded.</p>

<p>Attie et al. (1980) stated that familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which was first reported by Foley et al. (1972) as familial benign hypercalcemia, is the first-to-be-described parathormone-independent renal tubular defect in calcium reabsorption. Menko et al. (1984) presented the hypothesis that the abnormality may involve the 'setting of the parathyroid gland,' a process that seems to occur in the perinatal period, and that the fundamental defect may be in renal calcium handling. Among 67 patients referred after unsuccessful surgery for presumed primary hyperparathyroidism, Marx et al. (1980) found that 6 were members of kindreds with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. This disorder achieves greater practical importance as routine biochemical screening becomes widely practiced. Marx (1980) estimated that about 25 patients with this disorder undergo unsuccessful parathyroidectomy in the United States each year. Furthermore, their hypercalcemic relatives are usually not recognized or informed of the mild nature of their disorder. Unlike primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of this origin begins before age 10 years and is not accompanied by urinary stone or renal damage. The only complications attributable to the hypercalcemia are pancreatitis and chondrocalcinosis. Parathyroid hyperplasia is found in most cases, but hypercalcemia usually persists after parathyroidectomy. Both the kidneys and the parathyroid glands seem insensitive to chronic hypercalcemia. In some cases circulating parathormone levels are elevated and can lead to neonatal severe 'primary hyperparathyroidism' in offspring of affected women. A simple diagnostic test is the ratio of renal calcium clearance to creatinine clearance; a value below 0.01 suggests familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. The finding of hypercalcemia in first-degree relatives supports the diagnosis, particularly when found in children under age 10 years. Lipomas may be a pleiotropic effect of the FHH gene (Levine, 1980).</p>

<p>Paterson and Gunn (1981) found this disorder in at least 10 members of 4 generations of a large kindred. Parathyroid exploration had been performed in 3 members (twice in 1) before it was realized that they did not have primary hyperparathyroidism. The relation to neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism was discussed further by Marx et al. (1982). In some instances, NSPH may represent the homozygous state of FHH. Menko et al. (1983) identified 27 hypercalcemic persons in 3 generations of a large kindred. Five had had parathyroid surgery. The patients tend to have hypermagnesemia as opposed to the hypomagnesemia of hyperparathyroidism. Increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption and persistent normal functioning of the parathyroid glands in the face of hypercalcemia remain the sole definite abnormalities of the syndrome. Steinmann et al. (1984) and Marx et al. (1985) presented evidence that FHH can show only intermittent and very mild hypercalcemia in heterozygotes and that in the homozygous state the gene can cause neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism. This hypothesis was proven by Pollak et al. (1994). The kindred on which Marx et al. (1985) based this conclusion was first reported by Hillman et al. (1964) as an instance of autosomal recessive neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism. Two offspring of first-cousin parents were affected. Only later was FHH described and was it realized that most cases of neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism occur in families with FHH.</p>

<p>Marx et al. (1985) concluded that of 22 reported cases of NSPH, 9 were in kindreds with definite or probable FHH. In 3 kindreds, because of normocalcemia in both parents and, in 2 of them, parental consanguinity, autosomal recessive inheritance was suggested. It was one of these 3 kindreds that Marx et al. (1985) restudied. The mild and intermittent nature of hypercalcemia in heterozygotes was responsible for the earlier misinterpretation. The frequency of gallstones is increased; indeed, this is the only discernible increase in medical problems. Skeletal mass is normal and fractures do not occur with increased frequency (Law and Heath, 1985).</p>
