<p>Rukavina et al. (1959) reported the disorder in 4 generations of a family. The features were short stature, mongoloid facies, short spadelike hands, broad thumbs in valgus position, genu recurvatum and generalized limitation of joint mobility, thickening of the palmar and forearm fasciae, enlargement of the posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae, and shuffling short-stepped gait. The condition described by Moore and Federman (1965) (Moore-Federman syndrome;) has some similarities. Booth (1975) observed father and son with this condition. Both had laryngeal stenosis.</p>
