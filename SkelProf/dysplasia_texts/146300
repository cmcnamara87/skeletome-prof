<p>Disease characteristics. Hypophosphatasia is characterized by defective mineralization of bone and/or teeth in the presence of low activity of serum and bone alkaline phosphatase. Clinical features range from stillbirth without mineralized bone at the severe end to pathologic fractures of the lower extremities in later adulthood at the mild end. At least six clinical forms are currently recognized based on age at diagnosis and severity of features, including: (1) perinatal (lethal) hypophosphatasia characterized by respiratory insufficiency and hypercalcemia; (2) perinatal (benign) hypophosphatasia with prenatal skeletal manifestations that slowly resolve into the milder childhood or adult form; (3) infantile hypophosphatasia with onset between birth and age six months of rickets without elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity; (4) childhood hypophosphatasia that ranges from low bone mineral density for age with unexplained fractures to rickets; (5) adult hypophosphatasia characterized by early loss of adult dentition and stress fractures and pseudofractures of the lower extremities in middle age; and (6) odontohypophosphatasia characterized by premature exfoliation of primary teeth and/or severe dental caries as an isolated finding or as part of the above forms of hypophosphatasia.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Although formal diagnostic criteria are not established, all forms of hypophosphatasia (except pseudohypophosphatasia) share in common reduced activity of unfractionated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and presence of either one or two pathologic mutations in ALPL, the gene encoding alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme (TNSALP). ALPL is the only gene known to be associated with hypophosphatasia.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: Perinatal lethal type: expectant management and family support. Infantile types: respiratory support, treatment of hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria; treatment of seizures with vitamin B6; routine treatment of craniosynostosis. All other types: routine dental care starting at age one year; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for osteoarthritis, bone pain, and osteomalacia; internal fixation for pseudofractures and stress fractures.</p>

<p>Surveillance: dental visits twice yearly starting at age one year; monitoring children with infantile type for increased intracranial pressure secondary to craniosynostosis.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: bisphosphonates, excess vitamin D</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The milder forms, especially adult and odontohypophosphatasia, may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner depending on the effect that the ALPL mutation has on TNSALP activity. In autosomal recessive hypophosphatasia, heterozygotes (carriers) either are asymptomatic, manifesting biochemical but not clinical abnormality, or may manifest milder symptoms depending on the mutation. Although de novo mutations have been reported, in most instances each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an "asymptomatic" carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. In autosomal dominant hypophosphatasia most probands have an affected parent; de novo mutations have not been reported. Each child of an individual with the autosomal dominant form of hypophosphatasia has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. For both modes of inheritance, prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if disease-causing mutation(s) of an affected family member are known. Recurrence of perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia may reliably be identified by prenatal ultrasound examination.</p>
