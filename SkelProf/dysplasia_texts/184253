<p>Kozlowski et al. (1988) reported an Algerian family in which 5 members had a seemingly 'new' form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. It was considered possible that the patient reported by Schmidt et al. (1963) had this disorder. None of the spondylometaphyseal dysplasias show a combination of such severe metaphyseal changes and severe genu valgum. Among the metaphyseal dysplasias, only the Jansen type shows severe metaphyseal changes, but in that disorder genu varus deformity is found and sclerosis of the skull is a common finding in older patients (Holthusen et al., 1975).</p>
