<p>This is one of the group of disorders formerly called metaphyseal dysostosis. Spahr and Spahr-Hartmann (1961) described 4 sibs, of normal but consanguineous parents, in whom bowing of the legs was striking; at least 1 sib required bilateral osteotomy. Farag and Teebi (1990) described a second family with this type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Among the children of consanguineous, phenotypically normal parents, 4 sibs (3 females and 1 male) were affected.</p>

<p>Spahr type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia may be the same as cartilage-hair hypoplasia variant with skeletal manifestations only.</p>
