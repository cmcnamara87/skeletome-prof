<p>In humans, 2 isoforms of PAPS synthetase, PAPSS1 and PAPSS2, catalyze the synthesis of 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate (PAPS) from inorganic sulfate and ATP. PAPS is the sulfate donor cosubstrate for all sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes. SULTs catalyze the sulfate conjugation of many endogenous and exogenous compounds, including drugs and other xenobiotics (summary by Xu et al., 2002).</p>
