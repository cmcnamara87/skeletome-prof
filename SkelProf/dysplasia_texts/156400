<p>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that the disorder is caused by constitutively active mutations in the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR;).</p>

<p>This disorder was formerly known as metaphyseal dysostosis. Stoeckenius (1966) described affected mother and child. The mother's condition may have been the result of new dominant mutation. Her father was 40 years old at her birth. Lenz (1967) saw the same family. The mother was only 102 cm tall. The extreme disorganization of the metaphyses of the long bones and of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones is in sharp contrast to the almost normal appearance of the epiphyseal centers, which on x-ray appear widely separated from the long bones. The chin is receding. The fingers, especially the distal phalanges, are very short. The spine, pelvis, and lower legs are distorted. De Haas et al. (1969) gave a follow-up of the original case of Murk Jansen (1934). The striking feature at age 44 was the development of nearly normal bone structure with, however, marked deformity and dwarfing. Sclerosis in the cranial bones, including the petrous bone, leading to deafness, was demonstrated. Sclerosis of the skull is a common finding in older patients (Holthusen et al., 1975). Charrow and Poznanski (1984) observed affected mother and daughter. Gordon et al. (1976) described a case in which severe radiographic manifestations were detected at birth. Linear growth was significantly retarded at 2 years of age.</p>

<p>Hypercalcemia has been noted in cases in childhood (Lenz, 1969; Holt and Dent in discussion of Lenz, 1969). See the follow-up by Lenz (1969). Kruse and Schutz (1993) noted that 7 of 16 patients described to that time presented with hypercalcemia. They reported studies of calcium metabolism in a hypercalcemic girl with this disorder during the first year of life. Biochemical indices of bone turnover indicated increased bone resorption without sufficient compensatory bone formation. Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, elevated urinary phosphate and cyclic AMP excretion, and increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in serum despite suppressed or low normal values of circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH;) and PTH-related peptide (PTHRP;) were found. Kruse and Schutz (1993) suggested that the hypercalcemia was caused by an unknown factor, which was not PTH or PTHRP, with osteolytic activity and stimulatory effect on the proximal renal tubule. The patient in their study presented at birth with prominent eyes, choanal stenosis, wide cranial sutures, high arched palate, micrognathia, rib fractures, and irregularities of the metaphyses of the long bones resembling rickets. At the age of 3.5 years, she showed height of 86 cm, waddling gait, enlarged joints, prominent supraorbital ridges, and frontonasal hyperplasia.</p>

<p>Karaplis et al. (1994) disrupted the parathyroid hormone-related peptide in murine embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination, and introduced the null allele into a mouse germline. Mice homozygous for the null mutation died postnatally, probably from asphyxia, and exhibited widespread abnormalities of endochondral bone development. Histologic examination revealed a diminution of chondrocyte proliferation, associated with premature maturation of chondrocytes and accelerated bone formation. Analysis of earlier developmental stages revealed that disturbance in cartilage growth preceded abnormal endochondral bone formation. There was no morphologic abnormality apparent in other tissues. Schipani et al. (1995) demonstrated an activating mutation of the PTH receptor gene (PTHR) in a patient with Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. A patient with this disorder was heterozygous for a nucleotide change that caused a his223-to-arg substitution in the first intracellular loop of the PTH receptor (<a href="/entry/168468#0001">168468.0001</a>). Both parents lacked the mutation. COS-7 cells expressing the mutant PTHR showed ligand-independent cAMP accumulation that was approximately 4-fold higher than that observed with cells expressing the wildtype PTHR. Although no mutation was identified in the DNA from 2 other patients with Jansen type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (Juppner, 1995), 2 patients were found to have the his223-to-arg mutation.</p>

<p>To further characterize the roles of positions 223 and 410 of human PTH/PTHRP in activation of the cAMP pathway, Schipani et al. (1997) replaced the native residues at these sites, histidine and threonine, respectively, by all 19 natural amino acids. At position 223, only arginine and lysine led to agonist-independent cAMP accumulation. All other substitutions resulted in receptor mutants that lacked constitutive activity or were uninformative due to poor cell surface expression. In contrast, most substitutions at position 410 conferred constitutive cAMP accumulation with little effect on receptor expression. Schipani et al. (1997) stated that the PTH/PTHRP receptor residues mutated in Jansen disease are conserved in all mammalian members of this family of G protein-coupled receptors. The authors concluded that residues 223 and 410 of the human PTH/PTHRP receptor have critical roles in signal transduction, but different sequence constraints.</p>
