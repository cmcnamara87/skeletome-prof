<p>Disease characteristics. Hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) is characterized by limb malformations and urogenital defects. Mild bilateral shortening of the thumbs and great toes, caused primarily by shortening of the distal phalanx and/or the first metacarpal or metatarsal, is the most common limb malformation and results in impaired dexterity or apposition of the thumbs. Urogenital abnormalities include abnormalities of the ureters and urethra and various degrees of incomplete MÃ¼llerian fusion in females and hypospadias of variable severity with or without chordee in males. Vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, and chronic pyelonephritis are common; fertility is normal.</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. Diagnosis is based on physical examination including radiographs of the hands and feet and imaging studies of the kidneys, bladder, and female reproductive tract. HOXA13 is the only gene known to be associated with HFGS. Approximately 60% of mutations are polyalanine expansions. Molecular genetic testing is clinically available.</p>

<p>Management. Hand or foot surgery is not usually necessary. Ureteric reimplantation and surgical correction of bladder outlet abnormalities is often necessary. Surgical removal of a longitudinal vaginal septum is rarely indicated. Surgery for removal of a uterine septum or reunification of a bicornuate uterus is exceptional in the absence of recurrent mid-trimester pregnancy loss. Hymenectomy may be necessary for tight constriction ring. Surveillance involves follow-up with a urologist in the presence of vesicoureteral reflux and/or documented urinary tract infection.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Hand-foot-genital syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown because of the small number of individuals described. If a parent of the proband is affected, the risk to the sibs is 50%. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low. Each child of an individual with HFGS has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal testing may be available through laboratories offering custom prenatal testing for families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member.</p>
