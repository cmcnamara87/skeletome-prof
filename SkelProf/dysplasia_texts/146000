<p>Hypochondroplasia is a autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, lumbar lordosis, short and broad bones, and caudad narrowing of the interpediculate distance of the lumbar spine. It shows some resemblance to achondroplasia, but is much milder and can be distinguished on clinical and radiographic grounds (Walker et al., 1971).</p>
