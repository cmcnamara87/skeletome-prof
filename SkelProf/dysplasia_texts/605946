<p>Braun et al. (2001) described a distinct autosomal dominant type of metaphyseal dysplasia in 5 generations of a German kindred. The main characteristics were metaphyseal widening and undermodeling of the tubular bones with unusually severe varus deformity of the radii and flat exostoses of the long bones localized in the metaphyses. The skull was unaffected. By linkage analysis studies, they excluded allelism with craniometaphyseal dysplasia, which had been mapped to 5p14-p12. They distinguished this disorder from the Pyle type of metaphyseal dysplasia by the different mode of inheritance and by the marked varus deformity of the club-shaped distal portion of the radius with irregularities of spongiosa, a minus variant of the ulna, and the flat metaphyseal exostoses on the long bones.</p>

<p>Braun et al. (2001) noted that Fried and Krause (1972) may have described the same disorder under the label Pyle type metaphyseal dysplasia. Fried and Krause (1972) reported 1 sporadic individual and 5 members of 2 other families, all of whom originated from a small town in northern Bohemia. Ancestors of the family reported by Braun et al. (2001) originated from the same area, making a common ancestor likely. Male-to-male transmission was observed in both families. Notably, all affected persons reported by Fried and Krause (1972) had marked varus deformities of the radius. In addition, flat exostoses, located on the lower legs, were described in some patients. One patient had an exostosis of a rib.</p>

<p>Takata et al. (2006) reported a 7-year-old Japanese girl with Braun-Tinschert metaphyseal dysplasia. On x-ray, osteosclerosis of the chondroosseous junctions, metaphyseal cortices, and epiphyseal margins and exostosis-like bone excrescences at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junctions were more prominent at age 4 years than at age 7. Other findings included coarse metaphyseal trabeculae, varus deformity of the humeri, and mild bowing of the ulnae and fibulae. The mean bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was lower than that of age-matched controls. The patient exhibited premature loss of primary teeth, likely indicating increased periodontal bone resorption. Markers of bone formation and resorption were both increased, signaling a high rate of bone turnover. There were no other affected individuals in the family. Takata et al. (2006) noted that this was the first reported patient with this disorder originating outside of Bohemia.</p>
