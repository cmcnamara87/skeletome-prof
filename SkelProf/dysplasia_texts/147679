<p>IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) is a protein that binds to IL1 receptors (IL1R1;) and inhibits the binding of IL1-alpha and IL1-beta (IL1B;). As a consequence, the biologic activity of these 2 cytokines is neutralized in physiologic and pathophysiologic immune and inflammatory responses. IL1RN was the first-to-be described, naturally occurring cytokine or hormone-like molecule to function as a specific receptor antagonist (Arend, 1991)</p>
