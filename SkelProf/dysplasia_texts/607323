<p>Duane-radial ray syndrome, also known as Okihiro syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by upper limb anomalies, ocular anomalies, and, in some cases, renal anomalies. The combination of the 3 findings was earlier referred to as 'acro-renal-ocular syndrome.' The ocular anomalies usually include Duane anomaly (see), but this finding may be absent in some patients (Kohlhase et al., 2003). Similarly, renal anomalies are not always seen and may not have been investigated, particularly in cases reported before routine renal imaging (Aalfs et al., 1996). Other less common features include sensorineural deafness and gastrointestinal anomalies, such as imperforate anus.</p>

<p>The Holt-Oram syndrome, caused by mutation in the TBX5 gene on chromosome 12q24, shows similar anomalies of the upper limb, but can be differentiated from Duane-radial ray syndrome by the absence of ocular and renal anomalies and the presence of severe congenital heart defects (Kohlhase, 2003).</p>
