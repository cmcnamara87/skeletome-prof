<p>Doffinger et al. (2001) examined 2 unrelated male patients who presented with the novel OL-EDA-ID syndrome. Both were sons of mothers with mild incontinentia pigmenti, and both died of overwhelming multiple infections at 2.5 and 1.5 years of age, respectively. Both had osteopetrosis, lymphedema, and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Immunologic variables in the second patient showed a poor inflammatory response and increases in the levels of blood inflammatory markers with fever either absent or delayed during infection. Blood monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells were normal in number and morphology. The B- and T-cell counts and responses to vaccine protein antigens were normal. Serum titers of antibodies against S. pneumoniae were low, despite proven infection. Serum titers of isohemagglutinins were low. Serum levels of immunoglobulin isotypes were normal for age, with the exception of low to normal IgG levels. Both patients carried an X420W mutation in IKBKG, or NEMO (<a href="/entry/300248#0002">300248.0002</a>). Different alleles were present at the flanking polymorphic loci in the 2 patients, indicating 2 independent mutational events. Both patients died of overwhelming infectious disease caused by a variety of microorganisms, including gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, and fungi. There were impaired cellular responses to TNF-alpha. Doffinger et al. (2001) compared the induction of IFN-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from one of the patients and a control. The patient's PBMC displayed a lower level of IFN-gamma production upon costimulation with IL12 (see) and various concentrations of IL1-beta or IL18 than the control PBMC. There were impaired cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide in this patient. The patient also exhibited dissociated cellular responses to CD154 (CD40LG;), suggesting that some but not all CD40-mediated signals are NEMO-dependent in both dentritic cells and B cells.</p>
