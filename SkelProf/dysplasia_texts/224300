<p>Spranger et al. (1968) used this term to distinguish a syndrome chiefly characterized by osteosclerosis and platyspondyly. The affected children are usually short and have a tendency to fracture. Cranial nerve compression occurs in some. Macular atrophy of the skin, flattened fingernails, and poorly calcified or chalky enamel has been noted. The calvaria, especially in the frontal area, and the base of the skull are sclerotic. The vertebral bodies are flattened, deformed, and diffusely dense. Whereas the rest of the long bones are sclerotic, widely splayed submetaphyseal portions are clear with irregularly coarse trabecular pattern. Affected sibs have been reported by Ellis (1934), Field (1939), and Stehr (1942). Parental consanguinity was noted by Spranger et al. (1968), Ellis (1934), and Field (1939).</p>

<p>Elcioglu et al. (2002) described in detail the radiologic findings in 3 patients with dysosteosclerosis, 2 of whom were sibs. One patient presented in infancy with blindness, and brain CT scan showed thick, dense bones, and markedly narrowed optic foramina. She later showed severe delayed psychomotor development and lost language development. Radiographs at age 14 years showed sclerosis of the skull base, abnormal dentition, osteosclerosis of the thorax, and platyspondyly and other abnormalities of the vertebral bodies. The long bones of the upper and lower limbs had striking expansion of their metadiaphyses and irregular sclerosis. The patient's younger brother presented in infancy with blindness due to optic nerve compression, and showed diffuse generalized sclerosis with irregularity of the proximal humeral metaphyses and platyspondyly on radiography. He died at age 10 months due to complications of bone marrow transplant. The third patient was blind with developmental delay. Radiologic evaluation at 6 months of age showed sclerosis with slender ribs, platyspondyly, and flared femoral metaphyses. At age 1 year, there was sclerosis of the skull base and striking bone abnormalities in the ribs. Elcioglu et al. (2002) discussed the differentiation of dysosteosclerosis from childhood osteopetrosis (see OPTB1,).</p>

<p>Lemire and Wiebe (2008) described the clinical and radiologic findings in a 46-year-old man with dysosteosclerosis who had first been reported by Houston et al. (1978). The patient was born to consanguineous parents. He was noted to be blind from birth, which was attributed to optic atrophy. He attended a school for the blind and was thought to have normal intelligence. Characteristic clinical features included proportionate short stature, oligodontia, delayed eruption of primary teeth, and multiple fractures following mild to moderate trauma. As an adult, he became deaf secondary to cranial nerve compression. He had one hospitalization for a single acute psychotic episode at age 42. He demonstrated classic radiologic features of dysosteosclerosis with diffuse sclerosis and platyspondyly. Other significant x-ray findings included osteopenia with multiple healed rib fractures.</p>
