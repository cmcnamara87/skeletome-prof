<p>Singleton and Merten (1973) and Gay and Kuhn (1976) reported a total of 4 unrelated patients, male and female, with dental dysplasia, progressive calcification of the thoracic aorta, calcific aortic stenosis, osteoporosis and expansion of the marrow cavities in hand bones like that observed in anemia. In 2 of the 4 patients, there was also generalized muscle weakness and atrophy beginning in the first or second year of life following a febrile illness. Onset was between 4 and 24 months and death between 4 and 18 years. The 2 patients of Gay and Kuhn had a chronic psoriasiform skin eruption. The father of one of their patients was said to have poor teeth and a 'leaky aortic valve,' so the disorder may be dominant. Feigenbaum et al. (1988) described a family with multiple affected members with variable expression and vertical transmission. Males were affected, and male-to-male transmission occurred. There was early loss of secondary dentition, and dental x-rays showed a type of dentin dysplasia with poor root development that was not like any other reported type.</p>
