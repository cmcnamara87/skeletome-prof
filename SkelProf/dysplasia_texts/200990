<p>The acrocallosal syndrome is an autosomal recessive mental retardation syndrome with brain abnormalities such as corpus callosum agenesis and/or Dandy-Walker malformation as well as dysmorphic features, postaxial polydactyly of the hands, and preaxial polydactyly of the feet (Schinzel and Schmid, 1980). It is considered a ciliopathy (Putoux et al., 2011).</p>

<p>Joubert syndrome-12 is a disorder with an overlapping phenotype characterized by the hallmark finding of the molar tooth sign (MTS) on brain MRI. For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of Joubert syndrome, see.</p>

<p>Hydrolethalus-2 (HLS2;) is an allelic disorder with a more severe phenotype and death in utero.</p>
