<p>Disease characteristics. Majeed syndrome is characterized by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) that is of early onset with a lifelong course, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) that presents as hypochromic, microcytic anemia during the first year of life and ranges from mild to transfusion-dependent, and transient inflammatory dermatosis, often manifesting as Sweet syndrome (neutrophilic skin infiltration).</p>

<p>Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing of LPIN2, the only gene known to be associated with Majeed syndrome.</p>

<p>Management. Treatment of manifestations: CRMO is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles and contractures. If CRMO does not respond to NSAIDs, corticosteroids can be used short term to control CRMO and skin manifestations; however, the complications of long-term use of corticosteroids limit their use in children. CDA is treated with red blood cell transfusion if indicated.</p>

<p>Surveillance: routine complete blood count (CBC) to determine if red blood cell transfusion is necessary.</p>

<p>Agents/circumstances to avoid: prolonged bed rest.</p>

<p>Genetic counseling. Majeed syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known.</p>
