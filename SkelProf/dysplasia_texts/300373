<p>Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) is an X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia that presents in females with macrocephaly, cleft palate, mild learning disabilities, sclerosis of the long bones and skull, and longitudinal striations visible on radiographs of the long bones, pelvis, and scapulae (Jenkins et al., 2009). In males this entity is usually associated with fetal or neonatal lethality. Occasional surviving males have, in addition to hyperostosis, cardiac, intestinal, and genitourinary malformations. Osteosclerosis in the cranial and facial bones leads to disfigurement and to disability due to pressure on cranial nerves, e.g., deafness. Osteopathia striata is a frequent feature of focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH;).</p>

<p>Although early reports of familial cases of this disorder appeared to suggest autosomal dominant inheritance (see, e.g., Horan and Beighton, 1978 and Konig et al., 1996), reappraisal of the literature (Behninger and Rott, 2000; Rott et al., 2003) and the finding of a molecular basis for the disorder by Jenkins et al. (2009) confirms that the inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Affected males who survive have a more severe phenotype than affected females, and sporadic male cases may result from somatic mosaicism (Behninger and Rott, 2000).</p>
