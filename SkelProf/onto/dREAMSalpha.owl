    >    This condition is diagnosed by the characteristic facial appearance and digital abnormalities. The hair is sparse, the nose bulbous and pear-shaped with notched alae nasi, the philtrum long and the ears protruding. The hands have prominent joints and the fingers are tapering with clinodactyly. Cone shaped epiphyses of the phalanges are apparent on X-ray. Many families have shown autosomal dominant inheritance. There are considerable similarities to the Langer-Giedion syndrome. Both conditions may be caused by small deletions of the long arm of chromosome 8 (see Goldblatt et al., 1986 and Fryns et al., 1986), however Ludecke et al., (1995) presented data suggesting that the TRP gene mapped more than 1000 kb proximal to the putative multiple exostoses gene and that both genes were deleted in Langer-Giedion syndrome. They also suggested that the genes responsible for mental retardation map outside this interval because Langer-Giedion patients with very small deletions are mentally normal, whereas TRP type 1 patients with large deletions extending more centromeric are mentally retarded. Sasaki et al., (1997) reported an 11 year old girl with a 4Mb deletion of 8q associated with a paracentric inversion with features of TRP type 1. She did not have mental retardation. Postaxial polydactyly was present in the hands.
    Sugio and Kajii (1984) reported a dominant family they thought represented Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Niikawa and Kamei (1986) reported a similar case, however the latter authors thought these cases had a form of tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (designated TRP type III). Nagai et al., (1994) and Itin et al., (1996) reported further three generation families where affected members had similarities to the cases reported by Sugio and Kajii (1984). The authors also wished to separate this condition out into TRP type III, because of the increased shortening of the hand bones, however the differences are not sufficiently marked to justify this, in our opinion. The pattern profile changes in affected individuals were similar to, but more pronounced than in TRP type I patients.
        Haan et al., (1989) reported a family where a paracentric inversion of chromosome 8 was segregating. Affected individuals had features both of Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome and Branchio-oto dysplasia and it was suggested that the gene for the latter was at either of these break-points. Gu et al., (1996) reported further molecular studies on this family indicating a megabase deletion.</abstract>

    >ACHONDROGENESIS TYPE IA</name>
    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Achondrogenesis type 1 (Parenti-Fraccaro type) and type 2 (Langer-Saldino type) cannot be distinguished clinically. Both result in stillbirth (or neonatal death) and are characterised by severe micromelia, a relatively large head, a short neck, a short trunk and a protuberant abdomen. Both have a flat nasal bridge and the whole nose is short with anteverted nostrils. Radiologically, ossification of the skull, spine and pelvis is more deficient in type 1 than in type 2. The long bones are more severely micromelic in type 1 and there are spiky metaphyseal spurs in both, but more so in type 1. Type 1 has been subdivided into types A (Houston-Harris type) and B (Parenti-Fraccaro type) (Kozlowski et al., 1978). Type 1-A cases have multiple rib fractures and almost complete lack of ossification of the spine. Chen et al., (1996) reported a case with features of type 1A with a posterior encephalocele. 
    It has been suggested that the cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd) mouse, which is caused by a mutation in the aggrecan gene, may be homologous to a form of human achondrogenesis (Watanabe et al., 1994).
    Superti-Furga (1994) demonstrated that core protein and side chains of proteoglycans were not sulphated in a patient with type 1B. A defect of biologic activation of sulphation, leading to defective sulphation of macromolecules, was postulated. Superti-Furga et al., (1996) demonstrated mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene in six patients with achondrogenesis type 1B. Cai et al., (1998) reported mutations in a further 17 week old fetus.
    Fryns et al., (1994) mention a possible case with a de novo balanced 4q23;11q13 translocation. Unfortunately no clinical photographs or radiographs were shown. Superti-Furga (1996) provides a good review of the clinical, histological, and molecular aspects of achondrogenesis type 1B.</abstract>

    >    This condition becomes evident in the first few years of life with joint stiffening, especially in the hands, short stature, mild facial coarsening, kyphoscoliosis and cloudy corneae. Radiographs reveal features of dysostosis multiplex. Mucopolysacchariduria and hepatosplenomegaly are absent. Mild mental retardation may be present and the condition seems to stabilise in the teens. Other ocular features include hyperopic astigmatism, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities (optic nerve head swelling and vascular tortuosity) and visual field defects (Traboulsi and Maumenee, 1986). Umehara et al., (1997) report the clinical features in 3 adult cases from the same inbred pedigree. The ages were 38, 61, 86 years. GNTTA levels were relatively high which may explain the long survival. The basic defect is in the enzyme that attaches a phosphate group to the mannose residue in lysosomal hydrolases (N-acetyl-a-glucosaminylphosphotransferase - GNPTA).  This is the same enzyme that is deficient in I-cell disease.  The gene has been mapped to 4q21-q23.
    Freisinger et al., (1992) reported a brother and sister (aged 9 years and 14 years) with a very mild form of the condition. The main clinical manifestations were a hip dysplasia and mild vertebral anomalies.
    Ward et al., (1993) reported a relatively mild form of the condition in four sibs from the United Arab Emirates.</abstract>

    >There are at least two forms of this condition (although some authors recongise four forms, Fraser (1957). One starts in utero and presents in the newborn period, whereas the other presents in childhood or even in adulthood. Both have reduced chondro-osseous mineralization with low levels of alkaline phophatase in blood, cartilage and bone. In the infantile form stillbirth is not infrequent, nor is early death due to respiratory insufficiency. The limb bones are deformed and sometimes fractured, and lethal osteogenesis imperfecta must be a diagnostic consideration. Bones are very poorly mineralized with irregular ossification. The ends are widened and frayed, producing a rachitic appearance. Some cases have been reported with unusual bony spurs (Vandevijver et al., 1998). The skull is poorly ossified and assumes a globular shape. The concentration of phosphoethanolamine is elevated in the urine. The tarda type is radiologically similar to rickets. This type is autosomal dominant whereas the severe type is autosomal recessive and has been mapped to 1p36.1-34. The two distinct clinical forms of the disorder usually run true in families, however they have occasionally been observed together (MacPherson et al., 1972; Eastman and Bixler, 1982; Macfarlane et al., 1992). Bracia et al., (1997) discussed treatment options in the infantile form.
    Mis-sense mutations have been demonstrated in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene (TNSALP) in both severe and mild cases (Weiss et al., 1988; Henthorn et al., 1992; Greenberg et al., 1993; Orimo et al., 1994; Goseki-Sone et al., 1998). These authors suggest that the clinical variability may be due to compound heterozygosity for different alleles. Zurutuza et al., (1999) reported genotype/phenotype correlation in this disorder. Mice homozygous for disruption of the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene do not appear to have skeletal abnormalities, but at 2 weeks of age develop seizures and die rapidly (Waymire et al., 1995). There is defective metabolism of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) resulting in reduced levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. Seizure activity can be reduced by administration of pyridoxal.
    Henthorn et al., (1995) reported successful prenatal diagnosis of a normal fetus at risk for the infantile form by direct mutational analysis of the TNSALP gene.

    >ACHONDROGENESIS TYPE I-B</name>
    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Achondrogenesis type 1 (Parenti-Fraccaro type) and type 2 (Langer-Saldino type) cannot be distinguished clinically. Both result in stillbirth (or neonatal death) and are characterised by severe micromelia, a relatively large head, a short neck, a short trunk and a protuberant abdomen. Both have a flat nasal bridge and the whole nose is short with anteverted nostrils. Radiologically, ossification of the skull, spine and pelvis is more deficient in type 1 than in type 2. The long bones are more severely micromelic in type 1 and there are spiky metaphyseal spurs in both, but more so in type 1. Type 1 has been subdivided into types A (Houston-Harris type) and B (Parenti-Fraccaro type) (Kozlowski et al., 1978). Type 1-A cases have multiple rib fractures and almost complete lack of ossification of the spine. Chen et al., (1996) reported a case with features of type 1A with a posterior encephalocele. 
    It has been suggested that the cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd) mouse, which is caused by a mutation in the aggrecan gene, may be homologous to a form of human achondrogenesis (Watanabe et al., 1994).
    Superti-Furga (1994) demonstrated that core protein and side chains of proteoglycans were not sulphated in a patient with type 1B. A defect of biologic activation of sulphation, leading to defective sulphation of macromolecules, was postulated. Superti-Furga et al., (1996) demonstrated mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene in six patients with achondrogenesis type 1B. Cai et al., (1998) reported mutations in a further 17 week old fetus.
    Fryns et al., (1994) mention a possible case with a de novo balanced 4q23;11q13 translocation. Unfortunately no clinical photographs or radiographs were shown. Superti-Furga (1996) provides a good review of the clinical, histological, and molecular aspects of achondrogenesis type 1B.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This severe short limb dysplasia is characterised at birth by short limbs, especially rhizomelic shortening, severe talipes, hitch-hiker thumbs, a cleft palate in many, a characteristic swelling of the pinnae, which assumes the character of a cauliflower ear, and occasional dislocations of joints. Respiratory problems, due to a narrow chest and micrognathia, can be a cause of early death. It might be that there are two separate types, lethal and non-lethal (q.v. Gustavson et al., 1985), but this is not universally accepted. Hall (1996) reported extreme variability within a sibship. Radiologically there is marked shortening of the first metacarpal, irregular lengths of the metacarpals, and bizarre ossification of the hand bones. Epiphyses and metaphyses are irregular and there is a V-shaped or chevron deformity at the distal ends of the femora and tibiae. The vertebral bodies are irregular. 
    Hastbacka et al., (1991) localized the gene to 5q and the same authors (Hastbacka et al., 1993) reported prenatal diagnosis using linked markers. Hastbacka et al., (1994) isolated the gene by positional cloning. It is a novel sulphate transporter gene. Rossi et al., (1996) reported cases heterozygous for a C862T transition, some of which had features of atelosteogenesis type 2 and some of diastrophic dysplasia. The other abnormal gene was not detected. Megarbane et al., (1999) reported a homozygous missense mutation in the DTDST gene in a year old child with features of diastrophic dysplasia, but with some unusual skeletal findings including platyspondyly, wide metaphyses and fibula overgrowth.
    Jung  et al., (1998) reported prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound scan at 20 weeks, however reviewing the X-rays the features of the fetus seemed more compatable with atelosteogenesis type I.</abstract>

    >The main problem for the clinical geneticist is not usually the diagnosis. Although it should be noted that mild and severe cases can occur within the same family, there is evidence that in the majority of cases the condition does breed true. Hemizygous males can be diagnosed by analysing amniotic fluid cells (estimating sulphoiduronate  sulphatase activity), and amniotic fluid (by thin layer chromatography of mucopolysaccharides), but these are fairly late tests and most patients would want to consider tests on a chorion villus sample. This has been achieved and should be the method of choice. Occasional cases in females have been shown to be due to skewed X chromosome inactivation (Sukegawa et al., 1997)
    Carrier detection is a greater problem, in that the discrimination between enzyme levels in heterozygotes and normal homozygotes in serum or hairbulbs is not absolute, but gives a probability of being a carrier. About 30% of cases have gene deletions and carrier detection using in situ hybridization has been achieved (Stone and Adinolfi, 1992). Froissart et al., (1997) provided evidence of germline and somatic mosaicism in a female. Other hot spots in the gene for mutations have also been described (Rathman et al., 1996). Timms et al., (1998) reported further mutations and deletions. Inversions, probably caused by recombination between the IDS gene and a pseudogene are also frequent (Lagerstedt., 1997; Bunge et al., 1998). Further mutations were reported by Li et al., (1999) and Vafiadaki et al., (1998).</abstract>

    Achondrogenesis type 2 probably represents the most severe end of the spectrum of the group of conditions including hypochondrogenesis and spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Defects of type II collagen synthesis have been demonstrated in some cases (Eyre et al., 1986; Horton et al., 1987) and it seems likely that most cases are caused by new dominant mutations. Mortier et al., (1995) demonstrated a single base change that resulted in the substitution of glycine by arginine in the triple helical domain.
    Soothill et al., (1993) reported a case diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation.</abstract>

    >Maclean et al., (1983) reported a male infant with short angulated femurs and bowing of other long bones. There were deep dimples over the angulation of the femurs. The face was characterised by micrognathia and a capillary haemangioma over the forehead and glabella. The bowing of the long bones appeared to improve with age. Pitt (1986) pointed out the similarities to femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome. 
    Khajavi et al., (1976), Hall and Spranger (1980), Rezza et al., (1984) and Temple et al., (1989) reported similar cases.
    O'Reilly and Hall (1994) reported a six year follow-up on the child first described by Temple et al., (1989). At 3 years Perthes disease of the right capital femoral epiphysis was noted, and at 6 years changes of bilateral avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphyses were diagnosed. A hydronephrotic right kidney caused by vesicoureteric obstruction was also noted.
    Turnpenny et al., (1990) reported two sibs, including one with pure red-cell aplasia. They provide a good review of the other cases. Associated features include mesomelic or rhizomelic shortening of the upper limbs, short ribs, flared irregular metaphyses and mid-face hypoplasia. Intelligence is usually normal. This may well be a heterogeneous group. Inheritance is possibly autosomal recessive.
    Corder et al., (1995) reported a 2-month-old male who died with severe combined immunodeficiency who had some radiological features of the condition, however this case may fall into the 'round inferior femoral epiphysis dysplasia' group (qv) or the probably heterogeneous group of 'dwarfism-immunodeficiency type 1'.
    Cisarik et al., (1996) reported a case with some features of the condition who died in the neonatal period. A sib had been similarly affected. There seemed to be a more generalised bone dysplasia in this case with similarities to Melnick-Needles syndrome (qv). Chen et al., (1998) reported two sib fetuses with features of the condition. One was picked up at 26 weeks gestation by ultrasound scan and the next sib at 23 weeks. The mother had featues of brachydactyly type E.</abstract>

    >This well documented autosomal dominant condition can be very variable (see Dixon et al., 1994). The main features are symmetrical facial abnormalities consisting of malformed ears, malar hypoplasia, a coloboma of the lateral part of the lower lid, mandibular hypoplasia, a cleft palate and sensorineural deafness. The syndrome must be differentiated from Goldenhar syndrome, Nager syndrome and acrofacial dysostosis. The gene has been mapped to 5q31-5q33 (Dixon et al., 1991, 1993; Jabs et al., 1991, 1993). Edery et al., (1994) found no evidence for genetic heterogeneity by linkage analysis. Dixon et al., (1996) isolated the gene and named it Treacle. There is no known homology to other genes. Mutations resulted in premature termination of the protein. Gladwin et al., (1996) reported further mutations leading to haploinsufficiency. Paznekas et al., (1998) isolated the mouse gene and showed that it was expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues. The protein was thought to have motifs expressed in nucleolar phosphoproteins. Winokur and Shiang (1998) showed that the protein was targeted to the nucleolus by signals in its C-terminus. Marsh et al., (1998) showed that mutations in the Treacher Collins gene caused the protein to be localised at different compartments of the cell when putative nuclear localisation signals were deleted.
    Robb et al., (1991) reported a case with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula, a rectovaginal fistula and anal atresia.
    Autosomal dominant inheritance is well established, however Richieri-Costa et al., (1993) reported two affected brothers with apparently unaffected parents and one other affected girl with first cousin parents. They reviewed other possible autosomal recessive cases in the literature. It is difficult to rule out incomplete expression or germinal mosaicism in these rare families.
    Hansen et al., (1996) reported a severly affected case with arhinia and uveal colobomas together with almost absent ears.  Mother was mildly affected, the sister was a classical case, and the father was apparently unaffected.
    Arn et al., (1993) reported a 21-month-old girl with mild mandibulofacial dysostosis and a deletion of 3p24.1.</abstract>

    >This condition is characterised by bowing of the femur and tibia, sometimes with overlying skin dimples. The main facial features are a large head, a small jaw, a cleft palate and a flat nasal bridge. The ears may be malformed and low-set. The chest is narrow and respiratory distress is common. Congenital dislocation of the hip occurs in the majority of patients, as does bilateral talipes equinovarus. A third of patients have cardiac defects (VSD, ASD, Fallot tetralogy) and a third of patients have hydronephrosis, mostly unilateral. There have been two patients with medullary cystic disease. Ambiguous genitalia occurs in the majority of patients with an XY karyotype. Other frequent malformations include laryngomalacia or tracheomalacia, hydrocephalus and arrhinencephaly. Characteristically the scapulae are hypoplastic, the iliac wings are vertical and narrow, there is poor ossification of the pubis, and non-mineralization of the pedicles of the thoracic vertebrae. The 1st metacarpals are short and there may be 11 pairs of ribs. MacPherson et al., (1989) described two cases with all the radiological features apart from camptomelia. Normann et al., (1993) estimated the incidence in Norway to be 1.6 per 10,000, although in other populations a birth prevalence of 1 in 200,000 has been suggested (Mansour et al., 1995).
    Inheritance has been suggested to be autosomal recessive, however sib recurrence risk is only about 5% and this, together with the report of an affected parent and child (Lynch et al., 1993), suggests that many cases may be caused by new autosomal dominant mutations (Mansour et al., 1995). 
    Cooke et al., (1985) reported a case with a familial, balanced 5;8 translocation (t(5;8)(q33;q21.4)). Maraia et al., (1991) reported a case with a de novo 17q paracentric inversion (q12;q25). Young et al., (1992) reported a case with a de novo 2;17 translocation (t(2;17)(q35;q23-q24)). Tommerup et al., (1993) studied three cases with features of camptomelic dysplasia and translocations involving 17q24-q25. Two of these cases were male and showed sex reversal. Ninomiya et al., (1995) reported a male with similar features and a 17q21 translocation. Pfeifer et al., (1999) studied translocation cases and noted that breakpoints were scattered over a 1Mb region proximal to SOX9. 
    Friedrich et al., (1992) pointed out that the condition can occur without overt camptomelia. They reported an affected female infant with marked joint hypermobility and reviewed cases from the literature (Bricarelli et al., 1981, Hovmoller et al., 1977, MacPherson et al., 1989). Zerres et al., (1993) and Glass and Rosenbaum (1997) reported a similar cases. Savarirayan and Bankier (1998) reported a case of acampomelic campomelic dysplasia with a de novo 5q;17q translocation.
    Foster et al., (1994); Wagner et al., (1994); Kwok et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the SOX9 gene, an SRY-related gene at 7q23-qter. Cases with translocations were not shown to have the gene directly disrupted however. Wirth et al., (1996) showed that in three patients with translocations the breakpoint was more than 130 kb from SOX9. Sudbeck et al., (1996) present data suggesting that nonsense and frame shift mutations lead to truncation of the C terminal transactivating domain leading to loss of transactivation of genes downstream from SOX9. Meyer et al., (1997) studied 12 patients and concluded that there was lack of genotype/phenotype correlation with regards to sex reversal. Bell et al., (1997) and Ng et al., (1997) showed that SOX9 regulates the type-II collagen gene. Bianchi and Beltrame (1998) review the function of SOX proteins. They appear to flex DNA and interact with a number of partners through POU domains.
	Cameron et al., (1996) reported a family where three sibs were affected. They demonstrated a heterozygous mutation in the affected children and gonadal mosaicism in the father. Interestingly, one sib had 46,XY true hemaphroditism, whereas another 46,XY sib had bilateral ovaries and normal female external genitalia.</abstract>

    >This well-studied condition is caused by a defect in renal tubular function leading to diminished reabsorption of phosphate with resulting hypophosphataemia. Affected individuals have short stature and vitamin D-resistant rickets; hypocalcaemia, muscle weakness, and tetany do not occur. Radiographs might show ricketic changes at the metaphyses, pseudo-fractures and sometimes areas of osteosclerosis. Occasional cases may have craniosynostosis (Willis and Beattie 1997). Treatment is with phosphate therapy and vitamin D analogues (Seikaly et al., 1994). The condition is X-linked dominant. Haffner et al., (1995) described their experience in treating growth in three children using growth hormone. Five children were treated by Seikaly et al., (1998). There was an improvement in linear growth and a transient increase in serum phosphate. Patzer et al., (1998) provides a good review. Kuether and Piatt (1998) reported a case associated with a Chiari malformation.
    In the mouse there are two X-linked loci, Hyp and Gy, giving hypophosphataemic rickets. Bolino et al., (1993) reported linkage in a four generation Italian pedigree segregating for an X-linked recessive form of hypophosphataemic rickets. The gene mapped to Xp11.2. A consortium of workers isolated a candidate gene for the disorder. This has homology to the endopeptidase gene family and was designated PHEX. Intragenic deletions were demonstrated in four separate families and three point mutations were also shown in other patients. Rowe et al., (1997) reported further deletions. Holm et al., (1997) reported further mutations. Strom et al., (1997) reported deletions in the Pex gene in both Hyp and Gy mouse, thus demonstrating that the two genes are allelic. The 3' end of the gene was deleted in Hyp mice and the first 3 exons of the promoter region were deleted in Gy mice. Further mutations in the PHEX gene were reported by Filisetti et al., (1999)</abstract>

    >These infants are severely hypotonic at birth and may have nystagmus and seizures. The face is characteristic with a tall forehead, hypoplastic supra-orbital ridges and lack of expression. The presence of epicanthic folds and Brushfield spots has sometimes led to the mis-diagnosis of Down's syndrome. Other findings include cataracts, camptodactyly, club feet, a large liver, stippled epiphyses and stippling of the patellae. Khoury et al., (1983) reported a case with features of VACTERL association and Hassinck et al., (1996) a case with anal atresia. Peroxisomes are missing in the liver and kidneys and the activities of multiple peroxisomal enzymes are reduced leading to deficiency of ether-glycolipids, and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, pipecolic acid and bile acid intermediates. Erdem et al., (1995) reported a case with intestinal lymphangiectasia.
    Naritomi et al., (1988) reported an affected female with a del(7)(q11.22q11.23) and Naritomi et al., (1989) reported a case with a 7p12q11 pericentric inversion, suggesting a tentative gene assignment at 7q11. 
    At the molecular level the disease is likely to be heterogeneous. At least six complementation groups have been demonstrated by somatic cell fusion studies (Brul et al., 1988; Roscher et al., 1989; McGuinness et al., 1990). Moser et al., (1995) demonstrated at least 16 complementation groups amongst cases with manifestations of a peroxisomal assembly disorder. 
    Shimozawa et al., (1992) demonstrated a point mutation in both alleles of the peroxisome assembly factor-1 gene (PAF-1; PEX2; PMP35; PXMP3) in a single patient. Shimozawa et al., (1993) reported a further patient with a PAF-1 mutation, and pointed out that at least nine genes must be involved in the assembly of peroxisomes.  Masuno et al., (1994) mapped the PXMP3 gene to 8q21.1.  Gartner et al., (1992) found a mutation in the 70K peroxisomal membrane protein gene (PMP70) in two patients. This gene maps to chromosome 1. Interestingly, one patient had apparently received one abnormal allele as a new mutation. However Paton et al., (1997) cast doubt on the role of the PMP70 gene as they could find no mutations in 12 patients from complementation group 1 and queries the role of this gene in the aetiology of Zellweger syndrome.  Poulos et al., (1995) reported further complementation groups.  In one case the features weren't typical of Zellweger syndrome facially but no photographs were shown. There was a right sided aortic arch and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis with a secundum atrial septal defect and a membranous ventricular septal defect. Fukuda et al., (1996) isolated the human PAF-2 gene (PEX6), mapped it to 6p21.1, and demonstrated mutations in two Zellweger patients belonging to group C. Other cases are likely to be due to mutations in genes coding for the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) receptors. Dodt et al., (1995) and Wiemer et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the PTS1 receptor (PEX5). Honsho et al., (1998) demonstrated mutations in the PEX16 gene in patients from complementation group D (complementation group IX in USA). Braverman et al., (1995), Fitzpatrick (1996) and Waterham and Cregg (1997) provide good reviews of disorders of peroxisome biogenesis.
    Chang et al., (1997) and Okumoto and Fujiki (1997) showed mutations in the PEX12 gene in patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders belonging to complementation group 3. Precise clinical details were not given. Chang and Gould (1998) report further mutations in seven cases. 
    Reuber et al., (1997), Portsteffen et al., (1997) and Tamura et al., (1998) reported common mutations in the PEX1 gene in patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders falling into the complementation group 1. A common PEX1 allele, G843D is present in approximately half group 1 patients. Maxwell et al., (1999) reported a common frameshift mutation in PEX1 in the Australian population. Okumoto et al., (1998) demonstrated mutations in the PEX10 gene in a patient from complementation group B. Imamura et al., (1998) showed that PEX1 mutations causing the Zellweger phenotype resulted in no peroxisomes being seen in fibroblasts from patients, whereas in mutations causing the infantile Refsum disease phenotype, peroxisomes were seen when the cells were cultured at 30 degrees centigrade, but not 37 degrees centigrade. Warren et al., (1998) found mutations in the PEX10 gene in one patient with the Zellweger phenotype and a further patient with features of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. Shimozawa et al., (1999) reported mutations in the PEX13 gene in a patient with the Zellweger phenotype. This gene codes for a protein, Pex13p, which is a SH3 protein, a docking factor for the peroxisome targeting signal 1 receptor (PEX5). This patient belonged to complementation group H.
    van Grunsven et al., (1999) reported two patients with features of a peroxisomal disorder (hypotonia, absence of suck reflexes, convulsions and craniofacial dysmorphism in one patient). Enoyl-CoA hydratase deficiency was demonstrated, indicating a new type of D-bifunctional protein deficiency. VLCFA levels were increased, however phytanic acid levels were normal as were levels of bile acid intermediates.</abstract>

    >    This form of microcephalic primordial dwarfism somewhat resembles Seckel syndrome, but there are important clinical and radiological differences. There is severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, a small forehead, a prominent nose, micrognathia and mental retardation. Limb shortening is mesomelic. Radiographs show short 1st metacarpals, short middle phalanges, short, curved, forearm bones, a V-shaped flare of the distal femoral metaphyses, coxa vara with a fragmented and flattened proximal femoral epiphysis, triangular distal femoral epiphyses, a high and narrow pelvis and pseudoepiphyses of the hands. The inheritance is uncertain, although one pair of possibly affected sibs and parental consanguinity have been reported (Verloes et al., 1987; Shebib et al., 1991). Herman et al., (1991) and Al Gazali et al., (1995) reported further cases and provide good reviews of the radiological features. 
    Masuno et al., (1995) reported a case with some features of the condition. However mesomelic shortening was seen in the legs but not in the arms, the pelvis was broad and not narrow, and there was no evidence of coxa vara or cupping of the distal femoral metaphyses.
    Lin et al., (1995) reported two brothers with the radiological features of the condition and microdontia. They pointed out that the cases reported by Majewski et al., (1982) and Shebib et al., (1991) had similar tooth abnormalities.
    Spranger et al., (1996) reported a case with some unusual features.  These included bilateral knee dislocation, breathing difficulties due to a microlarynx and misplaced upper lobe bronchus, severe undermineralisation of the skull and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Further cases were reported by Halder et al., (1998) and Majewski and Goecke (1998). The case reported by Halder et al., (1998) had normal intelligence but delayed central nervous system myelination with mild dilatation of the lateral ventricles at four years.</abstract>

    >    Achondrogenesis type 1 (Parenti-Fraccaro type) and type 2 (Langer-Saldino type) cannot be distinguished clinically. Both result in stillbirth or neonatal death and are characterised by severe micromelia, a relatively large head, a short neck, a short trunk and a protuberant abdomen. Both have a flat nasal bridge and the whole nose is short with anteverted nostrils. Radiologically, ossification of the skull, spine and pelvis is more deficient in type 1 than in type 2. The long bones are more severely micromelic in type 1 and there are spiky metaphyseal spurs in both, but more so in type 1. Rittler and Orioli (1995) reported a case with postaxial polydactyly. 
    Achondrogenesis type 2 probably represents the most severe end of the spectrum of the group of conditions including hypochondrogenesis and spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia congenita. Defects of type II collagen synthesis have been demonstrated in some cases (Eyre et al., 1986; Horton et al., 1987) and it seems likely that most cases are caused by new dominant mutations. Mortier et al., (1995) demonstrated a single base change that resulted in the substitution of glycine by arginine in the triple helical domain.
    Soothill et al., (1993) reported a case diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >The main features of this condition are a form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, defective cellular immunity, and glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome.
    Schimke et al., (1974) reported a 6-year-old girl with dwarfism, T-cell deficiency, nephrotic syndrome and excess excretion of chondroitin-6-sulphate. She had corneal opacities, sparse coarse hair, narrow palpebral fissures, shortening of the trunk, multiple lentigines, and pretibial oedema. Radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with kyphosis, an absent odontoid peg, broad ribs, acetabular dysplasia, subluxed femoral heads and lace-like iliac crests. Ehrich et al., (1990) reviewed the radiological aspects of the condition and Spranger et al., (1991) reported five further patients, including a brother and sister pair, and pointed out that the skeletal abnormalities are a form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Lama et al., (1995) reported three sibs with the condition. The parents were first cousins. Rottenburg et al., (1997) reported a further case. Kaitila et al., (1998) reported a case with autoimmune enteropathy which partially responded to a gluten free diet. This child had no skin pigmentation.
    Ludman et al., (1993) reported a further affected 3-year-old female and provided a good review. In addition to T-cell abnormalities she also had thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia. Santava et al., (1994) reported a 10-year-old girl and Hashimoto et al., (1994) a 16-year-old girl with the condition. Ehrich et al., (1995) reported 3 children who developed the syndrome at 5, 6 and 10 years. Positron emission tomography showed perfusion defects of both cerebral and cerebellar arteries. The children developed transient ischaemic attacks with severe neurological symptoms. Cerebral complications were also reported by Schmidt et al., (1997). They reported a patient with progressive white matter lesions. Boerkoel et al., (1998) reported two girls aged 7 and 11 with this condition who both had cerebral infarcts secondary to moyamoya.</abstract>

    >    Two brothers were reported by Sedaghatian et al., (1980) with mild rhizomelic shortening of the arms, mild platyspondyly, and a severe metaphyseal dysplasia. The chest was narrow and there was a lacy border to the iliac crests. There was a depressed nasal bridge and micrognathia in one boy, but no photographs are shown. Laboratory tests showed a low serum calcium, high phosphate, and high alkaline phosphatase, however these features were thought to be due to a renal defect. Both males died at 3 days and autopsy on one boy revealed pulmonary, renal and adrenal haemorrhage with subendocardial myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. The parents were not consanguineous, but the report of a probably affected female sib suggests autosomal recessive inheritance. 
    Opitz et al., (1987) reported a further possible case, however Spranger and Maroteaux (1991) feel this represented an unusual form of hypophosphatasia. Peeden et al., (1992) reported a possible case with an ASD and partial lissencephaly. Campbell et al., (1992) reported the radiological features of two possible cases.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This syndrome was first described by Nievergelt et al., (1944) in a father and three sons. The family was re-evaluated by Hess et al., (1978). Two further cases were described by Solonen and Sulamaa (1958) and Young and Wood (1974). A possible case was reported by Petrella et al., (1990) who provided a good review. The condition is a severe form of mesomelic bone dysplasia. The forearms are short and the elbows broad with restricted movement. There is severe mesomelia of the lower limb, with talipes equinovarus, caused by a hypoplastic tibia and a relatively long fibula. Radiographs reveal shortened, broad forearm bones, radioulnar synostosis, subluxation of the ulnar or radial head, but relatively normal hands. The tibia and fibula have a characteristic rhombdoidal shape. The case reported by Petrella et al., (1990) had absent fibulae and postaxial polydactyly of the right foot with syndactyly of toes 4-6. There was an extra triangular shaped bone between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals of the right foot. Vasil et al., (1997) reported a likely case with the characteristic tibia and fibula but with oligosyndactyly of the hands and feet.
     Urban and Kruger (1998) reported a historical female case whose mother was said to be affected.

    >Individuals with this disorder present with pain and limitation of movement in the joints. The overlying skin may be tense, shiny, erythematous or hyperaemic. Muscle atrophy and linear scleroderma may be other features. Radiographs reveal irregular linear opacities along the longitudinal axis of the bones. Histological examination reveals hyperostosis similar to that seen in osteopoikilosis. Sarcomatous change is rare and most cases are sporadic. The condition was first described and named by Leri et al., (1922) who pointed out the similarities of the radiographic features to flowing melted wax.
    Roger et al., (1994) reported a case with features of this condition associated with minimal change nephrotic syndrome, mesenteric fibromatosis and multiple capillary haemangiomas of the trunk.
    Iglesias et al., (1994) reported a 5 year old girl with radiological features of the condition who also had severe hypertension secondary to left renal artery stenosis.
    Nevin et al., (1999) reported a family where melorheostosis appeared to be segregating in an autosomal dominant fashion with osteopoikilosis. The proband had marked shortening and contractures of the right upper and lower limbs.</abstract>

    >Most cases of this condition are sporadic, although occasional familial recurrence has been reported. Saul (1987) reported an affected mother and son with the condition and reviewed the literature of other apparently dominant families. The enchondromas appear as translucencies primarily in the metaphyses, but also in the diaphyses and epiphyses. Fractures may occur through these lesions, and asymmetry of the limbs may be a problem. Schwartz et al., (1987) suggest that the incidence of low-grade osteosarcoma is 25% by the age of 40 years. Other associated tumours include granulosa-cell ovarian tumours.

    >It is postulated that Langer mesomelic dysplasia is the homozygous form of dyschondrosteosis (q.v.). Affected individuals have mesomelic shortening of the limbs with severe bowing of the radii and shortening of the ulnae. The tibiae and fibulae are short and the proximal ends of the fibulae may be hypoplastic. Goldblatt et al., (1987) described a family where an affected boy had parents with only mild abnormalities of the forearms.
    Roth et al., (1996) reported prenatal diagnosis of a homozyote where both parents had Dyschondrosteosis.
    Fryns (1995) reported a 15-year-old boy with both Langer mesomelic dysplasia and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), suggesting a possible location at 3q22.3-q23 for Langer mesomelic dysplasia.
    Toutain et al., (1991) reported a 3-generation pedigree segregating for Reinhardt-Pfeiffer syndrome. One case was diagnosed as a fetus with severe limb shortening suggesting Langer mesomelic dwarfism. The fetus had a XO karyotype. 
     Belin et al., (1998) and Shears et al., (1998) demonstrated common deletions around the SHOX gene in dyschondrosteosis. Point mutations leading to likely haploinsufficiency were also demonstrated. Shears et al., (1998) showed homozygous deletion of the SHOX gene in a fetus with Langer mesomelia. Belin et al., (1998) showed that an XO fetus with features of Langer mesomelia was hemizygous for a deletion of the SHOX gene.</abstract>

    >    Reardon et al., (1993) reported a brother and sister, the offspring of first cousin Pakistani parents. They had a form of mesomelic limb shortening associated with cleft palate, micrognathia, and camptodactyly. The radius and ulna and tibia and fibula were short and bowed with overlying skin dimples. Elbow extension was limited and the radial head was dislocated. There was a mild generalised platyspondyly with slight irregularity of the vertebral endplates. The sister died in the neonatal period of cardiorespiratory arrest and autopsy revealed small, hypoplastic lungs with only two lobes present on the right.

    >   This term was originally used by Stanescu et al., (1977) for a condition, lethal in the neonatal period, that radiologically resembled SED congenita and, morphologically, achondrogenesis type II. At present (Borochowitz et al., 1986) it seems likely that hypochondrogenesis and achondrogenesis type II are not distinct disorders, but are part of a disease spectrum. Clinically, the face is flat, with a depressed nasal bridge, a small thorax and a relatively large head. The limbs are short and the infant seems oedematous. Radiologically the ribs are short, the iliac wings are hypoplastic, the acetabular roofs are flat, the femora are short and there are severe metaphyseal irregularities. The vertebral bodies are almost unossified, especially in the cervical region. Less severely affected infants might show some thoracolumbar ossification. 
    Potocki et al., (1995) reported a case with an AV canal defect and another with an ASD.
    To date all cases have been sporadic, but inheritance is still uncertain. Horton et al., (1992) demonstrated a mutation in the COL2A1 (type II collagen) gene in a single case. Further mutations were reported by Vissing et al., (1989) and Bogaert et al., (1992).</abstract>

    >This condition is characterised by short stature, stubby digits and abnormal epiphyses. Presentation may be with short stature, a waddling gait or painful joints. Radiographs reveal fragmented epiphyseal ossification centres of the long bones with relative sparing of the vertebrae. Secondary osteoarthritic changes can occur. Sheffield (1998) emphasis the usefulness of a 'double-layered patella' as a diagnostic clue. The differential diagnosis between multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and mild cases of spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia or pseudoachondroplasia can be difficult. 
    Oehlmann et al., (1994) mapped the gene to 19q13 in a large dominant pedigree first reported by Weaver et al., (1993). Briggs et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in 19q linked families. A range mutations in pseudoachondroplasia-multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was reported by Briggs et al., (1998) and Deere et al., (1999). Further mutations in the COMP gene were reported by Ikegawa et al., (1998). Briggs et al., (1994) mapped the gene to 1p32-p33 in the family originally reported by Barrie et al., (1958). This gene maps close to the COL9A2 locus. Muragaki et al., (1996) demonstrated mutations in the COL9A2 gene in a large kindred segregating for multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. This was a splice site mutation causing exon skipping. A further large family where the disorder mapped to the COL9A2 locus was reported by van Mourik et al., (1998). Delot et al., (1999) reported trinucleotide expansion mutations in the COMP gene. This was a GAC repeat which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues in the calmodulin-like region of the protein. This was expanded to 6GAC in an MED pateint and 7GAC in a pseudoachondroplasia patient. About 1/3 of patients with pseudoachondroplasia have only 4GAC in this repeat.
    Deere et al., (1995) confirmed linkage to 19q13 in one family, but could find no evidence of linkage to this chromosome, nor to COL9A1, COL9A2 or COL11A2 in another family. COL11A1 was also excluded in this family under a recessive model. Note that type 9 collagen is made up of 3 separate chains coded for by the COL9A1 gene on chromosome 12, the COL9A2 gene on chromosome 1 and the COL9A3 on chromosome 20. Paassilta et al., (1999) demonstrated mutations in the COL9A3 gene in one family. Holden et al., (1999) reported two families with mutations in the COL9A2 exon 3/intron 3 splice donor site resulting in skipping of exon 3. The phenotype was described as \oligo-epiphyseal\, because in one family the knees and hands were affected, but not the hips or spine, and in the other family the lower limbs were particularly affected.
    Annunen et al., (1999) studied a 157 individuals with intravertebral disc disease and found 6 with a missense mutation in the COL9A2 gene, with no examples in controls. The mutations substituted a Trp for either Gln or Arg at position 326. There were no apparent features of MED.</abstract>

    >    Osteopoikilosis is a manifestation of the generalised condition disseminated dermatofibrosis. The radiological lesions appear as small areas of bony sclerosis throughout the skeleton, although largely sparing the skull. The skin lesions may appear at any time from birth to adult life. They consist of pea-sized papules (Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome). However, they may take on the appearance of yellow or white streaked discs or plaques and can be mistaken for pseudoxanthoma elasticum. There is also a deeper nodular form of lesion with the histological appearance of subcutaneous fibrosis. The histological appearance of the classical lesions consists of hypertrophic, broad interlacing elastic fibres which appear to encase collagen and are situated in the mid or lower dermis. Schnur et al., (1994) reported a family where one individual had spinal stenosis, and another otosclerosis. The literature of these complications was reviewed.
    Sclerosing haemangiomatosis of bone (see Abdelwahab, (1991) for a review) can give a somewhat similar radiological appearance.
    Some cases may just have the bony lesions without skin abnormalities (Sarralde et al., 1994). 
    Nevin et al., (1999) reported a family where melorheostosis appeared to be segregating in an autosomal dominant fashion with osteopoikilosis. The proband had marked shortening and contractures of the right upper and lower limbs.</abstract>

    >This condition is characterized clinically by psychomotor retardation, short stature and Hurler-like features. Most cases present before the child's first birthday, with poor weight gain and coarse facial features. Motor development may be more severely affected than cognitive development. Seizures are rare but can occur (Patel et al., 1980). The skin is often thick, tight and hirsute. Joint movement might be limited and fractures have been reported. Corneal clouding is occasionally present. A large liver and spleen occur in about a half of cases, and with time all seem to develop a gibbus. Beck et al., (1995) provide an excellent review and stress the variability of the condition both within and between families. 
    Biochemically there is a deficiency of N-acetyl-a-glucosaminylphosphotransferase (GNPTA) in fibroblasts and leukocytes. An initial screen consists of a search for vacuolated lymphocytes or large cytoplasmic inclusions in skin fibroblasts. An I-cell enzyme screen to show increased levels of a number of lysosomal enzymes in serum or the medium surrounding cultured fibroblasts, and a reduced level intracellularly. Carey et al., (1999) discuss prenatal diagnosis by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis of chorionic villi.</abstract>

    >Yunis and Varon (1980) described four girls and one boy from three Colombian families with a condition that partially resembled cleidocranial dysostosis, but which had additional features. Clinical features included dolichocephaly, wide anterior fontanelles, sparse hair, hypoplastic facial bones, thin lips, short philtrum, micrognathia, a narrow palate, absent thumbs, hypoplastic first toes and a micropenis. Radiographs revealed hypoplastic clavicles, aplasia or hypoplasia of the phalanges of the first toes, the middle phalanx of the 2nd finger and the distal phalanges of the 2nd to 5th fingers, as well as absence of the first metatarsals. All the cases died by the age of 10 weeks. 
    Hughes and Partington (1983) described a similarly affected boy aged 2 1/2 years. Additional features were microcephaly and soft tissue syndactyly. He had a dq of 40 at thirty months.  Ades et al., (1993) reported a case with tetralogy of Fallot and hypoplasia of the inferior cerebellum vermis.
    Garrett et al., (1990) described two male sibs with a condition resembling Yunis-Varon syndrome, but the clavicles were normal and additional features were present such as supra-acetabular constrictions and flared metaphyses. There were similarities to the severe form of osteodysplasty described by Kozlowski et al., (1973).
    In the case reported by Dworzak et al., (1995), there was evidence of a generalized lysosomal storage disorder in that vacuoles, some empty and some filled with a PAS-positive material, were found in muscle, heart, CNS, and in cultured fibroblasts.
    Rabe et al., (1996) report a further case and provide a good review of the literature.

    >This syndrome was first described by Robinow et al., (1969). The facial features are said to resemble those of a fetus, with a prominent forehead, hypertelorism, a wide mouth and and a small nose with anteverted nostrils. There may be significant gum hypertrophy. Samoud et al., (1993) reported a case with sensorineural deafness. Mesomelic limb shortening is usually (but not always) apparent. Other features include a micropenis in males, hydronephrosis or urinary tract infections, cleft lip and palate, and hemivertebrae. Balci et al., (1993) reported 14 cases from Turkey. Many of these cases had a split hand appearance and one had an extra hypoplastic mesoaxial digit. Because of the high incidence of consanguinity, it is possible that this series represents an unusual recessive form of the condition. Balci et al., (1998) reported a further case from Turkey with vaginal atresia, haematocolpos and an extra middle finger. The condition may be particularly frequent in Turkey (Aksit et al., 1997). The authors reported a case with almost complete syndactyly of the toes. Autosomal dominant and recessive families have been reported. Bain et al., (1986) reviewed the literature and noted that the definite recessive cases had significant vertebral anomalies and more severe mesomelic shortening of the arms, with abnormally modelled radii and ulnae. However this distinction may not be absolute. Note that stature can sometimes be normal (see Bain et al., 1996 and Saraiva et al., 1999). Robinow (1993) provides a good review. 
    Atalay et al., (1993) and Al-Ata et al., (1998) reported cases with tricuspid atresia and reviewed the evidence for congenital heart disease in this condition. They found that eight out of 53 cases had congenital heart defects. The lesions included ASD, Fallot tetralogy, coarctation of the aorta, valvular and peripheral pulmonary stenosis, VSD and PDA. The cases reported by Sabry et al., (1997) almost certainly did not have this condition. 
    It has been suggested that the cases described by Valle et al., (1982) have a separate condition - omodysplasia (qv). Schonau et al., (1990) reported a male infant who presented with ambiguous genitalia and persistence of the Mullerian ducts. Histology of the testes was normal whereas endocrinological studies showed partial deficiency of androgen receptors.

    >The Sutcliffe type of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia causes proportionate short stature and the facies are unremarkable. Diagnosis is made from the radiographs which reveal bilateral coxa valga, mild generalized metaphyseal changes in bone density and bullet or oval-shaped lower thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies (Kozlowski and Bellemore, 1989). In the hands the distal ends of the proximal and middle phalanges are pointed. Langer et al., (1990) reviewed seven cases and noted that triangular fractures of the corners of the metaphyses of the long bones were a feature. They coined the name spondylometaphyseal dysplasia - corner fracture type.
      The classification of the spondylometaphyseal dysplasias is still problematical. Maroteaux and Spranger (1991) propose a tentative scheme.</abstract>

    >    This autosomal dominant condition was probably first described by Werner in 1915. Expression can be variable, but the main features are symmetrical tibial aplasia, pre-axial polydactyly of hands and feet, and a five fingered hand with absence of the thumb. Lamb et al., (1983) point out that a five fingered hand, rather than a triphalangeal thumb, is the correct description of the hand anomalies in this syndrome, because the extra finger is non-opposable, unlike a triphalangeal thumb). 
    In the case reported by Kumar and Kruger (1993) (case 4) there was duplication of the fibula bilaterally with proximal focal femoral deficiency, radio-ulnar synostosis, triphalangeal thumbs and absence of the scaphoid and lunate. Vargas et al., (1995) reported a further case with duplication of the fibula. This child came from a large dominant pedigree where other affected members had normal tibiae and fibulae, or tibial hypoplasia.
    Ramirez et al., (1994) reported prenatal diagnosis of a case by ultrasound at 16.5 weeks of pregnancy.
    Slavotinek et al., (1999) reported a 17 week fetus with unilateral tibial aplasia associated with ipsilateral pre-axial polysyndactyly of the toes and femoral hypoplasia. There were also rib and vertebral anomalies. The relationship to other tibial aplasia syndrome was not certain.</abstract>

    >The pelvis in this form of lethal short-limbed dwarfism has a characteristic radiological appearance. It looks like a pair of snails because of the small, hypoplastic iliac wings, flat acetabulae and an unusual medial projection of bone that forms the head of the snail. Clinically the head is large, the neck and limbs very short and a cleft palate can be a feature. Peripheral oedema is common. Apart from the pelvic changes, other radiographic features are shortened long bones with expanded, irregular metaphyses, short splayed ribs, curved ('handle bar') clavicles, flat and severely hypoplastic vertebral bodies and advanced ossification of the carpus and tarsus. Borochowitz et al., (1986) described the chondro-osseous histology in detail. Spranger and Maroteaux (1991) briefly described two cases with features of Schneckenbecken dysplasia, but milder expression. It is not certain whether they represent a separate condition.</abstract>

    >This condition may be the same as Colavita (1984) (qv). It is a form of lethal short-limbed dwarfism. The limbs are extremely short with flared metaphyses, spicule-like projections from the ends of the long bones and transverse defects of the humeri, femora and tibiae. Calcification of the vault of the skull is virtually absent. There are ectopic ossification centres of the spine to give a stippled appearance, associated with platyspondyly. The ribs are very short and there appears to be a space between their proximal ends and the vertebrae. The ilia are crescent-shaped. Multiple ossification centres in the hands, feet, scapulae and ischia give a stippled appearance. In the Nairn and Chapman (1989) report three female sibs were affected - the parents were first cousins.
    Elcioglu and Hall (1998) report a further case, review the literature, and discuss the differential diagnosis and overlap with Dappled diaphyseal dysplasia  and Greenberg syndrome (hydrops-ectopic calcification-motheaten skeletal dysplasia - HEM)

    >Weissenbacher and Zweymuller (1964) first described a condition presenting at birth with short limbs, Pierre Robin sequence, expanded metaphyses of the long bones and coronal clefts of the vertebrae. Haller et al., (1975) reported further cases. It was noted that the long bones became relatively normal in length and shape with age. Kelly et al., (1982) described the phenotype in a baby whose father, brother and other family members had Stickler syndrome. A case was made for the phenotype being the early manifestation of Stickler syndrome. Winter et al., (1983) reported three further cases to support this conclusion. Case 2 in their paper has been cited in the literature as a case of Insley-Astley syndrome, but review at 9 years reveals a typical Marshall-Stickler phenotype, including cataracts and high myopia (Helen Hughes, personal communication, 1991). In the neonatal period the differential diagnosis includes Nance-Sweeney dwarfism, Insley-Astley and Kniest syndromes.
    Chemke et al., (1992) have suggested that Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome is in fact a distinct autosomal recessive syndrome. They cite the distinguishing features of the condition to be rhizomelic limb shortening with catch-up growth, lack of marked ocular abnormalities and absence of joint problems. However, this description overlaps with Insley-Astley syndrome (qv). It seems reasonable to assume at least one autosomal dominant condition (Marshall-Stickler) and one autosomal recessive condition (Insley-Astley syndrome) that can give this phenotype in infancy, however the existence of a third condition, as postulated by Chemke et al., (1992) is not certain as yet. In an isolated case caution is needed when assessing recurrence risks.
    Ramer et al., (1993) reported identical twins with this phenotype. One had an occipital encephalocele and the other a meningocele in the same area. One twin was significantly delayed and had hearing loss.
    Pihlajamaa et al., (1998) demonstrated a mutation in the COL11A2 gene in the patient originally described as having Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (qv) (Weissenbacher and Zweymuller 1964). This would suggest that the Weissenbacher-Zweymuller phenotype can be part of OSMED syndrome. </abstract>

    >    This is probably a distinct, but difficult to diagnose, short stature syndrome. The first two patients were seen at the Boston Floating and Harbor General Hospitals, hence the name. In one, the birth-weight was slightly reduced but in both subsequent height has always remained below the 3rd centile. The nose is broad, the mouth is large and the ears are low-set and posteriorly rotated. The skull is long from front to back and affected children have had mild developmental delay, especially of language. The neck is short but with a low/normal posterior hairline. The eyes are deep-set, but normally placed. Bone age is markedly delayed. Robinson et al., (1988) described further patients and provide a good review. Chudley and Moroz (1991) and Houlston et al., (1994) reported cases with coeliac disease. Ala-Mello and Peippo (1996) reported a case with a supernumerary upper incisor and an exceptionally high-pitched voice. Lazebnik et al., (1996) reported a case with a tetralogy of Fallot, but no clinical photographs were published.
    This can be a difficult clinical diagnosis and some cases in the literature are certainly doubtful (eg: case 1 of Patton et al., 1991; the case of Majewski and Lenard, 1991) - see Lipson (1991) for further comments.
    All cases have been sporadic.  However, Lacombe et al., (1995) reported a convincing case whose mother had some features of the condition (although the facial features in adulthood were not convincing). The diagnosis in the sibs reported by Fryns et al., (1996) is uncertain. </abstract>

    >There have been about twenty cases of this overgrowth syndrome reported in the literature. Most patients are large at birth, but overgrowth may not be apparent until a few months of age. In addition to the large size, the bone age is significantly advanced. Final adult height has been reported to be large in one patient, but others have shown deceleration of growth in childhood. The face may be distinctive with a broad forehead, large ears, hypertelorism, micrognathia (but with a prominent, dimpled chin) and a long philtrum. There might be a positional deformity of the elbows and knees with limitation of extension, as well as camptodactyly. The thumbs may be broad and prominent volar (fingertip) pads are seen. A general connective tissue abnormality is suggested by loose skin and hernias. An important additional feature is flaring of the metaphyses. Development is usually mildly delayed but can be normal. The condition is well reviewed by Cole et al., (1992). Ramos-Arroyo (1991) reported a case with severe retardation where overgrowth was only evident after 11 months when feeding difficulties in infancy were resolved.
    Although reports of possible autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported (Roussounis and Crawford, 1983; Dumic et al., 1993), the actual diagnosis in these cases is open to debate. Cole et al., (1992) report that the surviving sib reported by Roussounis and Crawford (1983) has a 5p- karyotype. The mother and son reported by Nishimura et al., (1996) are also doubtfully affected. Likewise the suggestion of dominant inheritance in case one of Ardinger et al., (1986) and case two of Majewski et al., (1981) must be considered with caution. Fryer et al., (1997) reported a possibly affected father and daughter, although convincing early infant photographs were not published. However, Proud et al., (1998) reported a convincingly affected father and two children.
    Scarano et al., (1996) reported a male with features of the condition, however he was severely mentally retarded and x-rays showed demineralisation of the bones of the hands and feet.
    Van Asperen et al., (1998) reported a mother and son with NF1 who both had an overgrowth syndrome resembling Weaver syndrome. They were shown to have a large deletion of 17q11.2  encompassing the entire NF1 gene.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >    Wolcott and Rallison (1972) described three affected children from a sibship of seven; Goumy et al., (1980) described two sibs and Stoss et al., (1982) also described two sibs. The main features are multiple epiphyseal/spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and diabetes mellitus. Onset is in early infancy; the diabetes may preceed the bone dysplasia. One patient of Stoss et al., (1982) was microcephalic and mentally retarded, but he was apparently in a diabetic coma for five days at the age of 10 weeks. Three patients developed renal insufficiency. Al-Gazali et al., (1995) reported two sibs with the condition. Diabetes developed within the first 2 months of life in each. This has been the case in other reported patients. Hand X-rays showed shortened middle and distal phalanges, cone-shaped epiphyses of the proximal phalanges, and small irregular carpal centres with several ivory epiphyses.
    Stewart et al., (1996) reported a three-and-a-half-year-old female with features of the condition.  She died at four years of age after an episode of hypoglycaemia.  At post-mortem examination endocardial fibroelastosis, a stenotic larynx, a markedly hypoplastic pancreas and arhinencephaly were found.  A 15q11-12 deletion was found in 65% of lymphocytes but the significance of this was not certain.</abstract>

    >WAARDENBURG SYNDROME TYPE III</name>
    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This autosomal dominant condition manifests with a white forelock, sometimes with more extensive depigmentation of the skin, sensorineural deafness, dystopia canthorum (an increased distance between the inner canthi), heterochromia of the irides, synophrys and a high nasal bridge. Some patients have premature greying of the hair, true hypertelorism (10%), cleft lip and palate (2-3%), Hirschsprung's disease, and a congenital heart defect (usually a VSD).
    Arias (1971) first suggested heterogeneity and Hageman and Delleman (1977) presented further evidence. In type I there is dystopia canthorum and 25% of patients have deafness; in type II there is no dystopia canthorum and over 50% of patients have deafness (Liu et al., 1995). Type I patients tend to have the distinctive facial features of a high nasal bridge, synophrys, and hypoplasia of the alae nasi.
    Type I has been localised to 2q37 (Foy et al., 1990) - da-Silva (1991) provides a good clinical review and Asher and Friedman (1990) a review of animal models. Farrer et al., (1992) estimated that approximately 45% of pedigrees in a sample of 41 WS type I and 3 WS type II families were linked to 2q37. Tassabehji et al., (1992) and Baldwin et al., (1992) demonstrated mutations in the HuP2 gene (the homologue of mouse Pax-3) in type I cases. This confirmed the homology to the Splotch mutant in the mouse (Moase and Trasler, 1992). Tassabehji et al., (1994) point out that PAX3 mutations in human Waardenburg cases, and the Splotch mouse, have close analogies including chromosomal deletions, splice-site mutations and similar amino acid substitutions. Tassabehji et al., (1993) showed a mutation in the human PAX3 gene in a family with probable type II Waardenburg syndrome. Farrer et al., (1994) showed that type I families, as defined by having significant dystopia canthorum, all mapped to the PAX3 gene without evidence of heterogeneity. Reynolds et al., (1996) provide evidence that suggests that an epigenetic locus or loci affects the degree of dystopia canthorum in type I cases. Morell et al., (1997) also provided evidence suggesting that genetic background affects expression of different PAX3 alleles. DeStefano et al., (1998) provide information about phenotype/genotype correlations with the PAX3 mutations. 
    Hughes et al., (1994) mapped the gene for type II Waardenburg syndrome to 3p12-p14 close to the human homologue of the mouse microphthalmia (mi) gene. Tassabehji et al., (1994) showed that mutations in the human homologue (MITF) of the mouse mi gene caused Waardenburg syndrome type II. This gene codes for a helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) protein. Two WS type II families were shown to have mutations affecting splice sites in the MITF gene. It should be noted that not all type II Waardenburg families appear to map to this locus. Van Camp et al., (1995) reported a patient with features of type II Waardenburg syndrome and a deletion of 13q21-q31. A family with features of type II Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung disease, not mapping to chromosome 2 or 3, but not excluded from 13q, was also described. The authors suggested that the endothelin-B receptor gene at 13q22 might be mutated in these cases. Tassabehji et al., (1995) review the mutational spectrum in both Waardenburg type I and type II. About 20% of type II cases are thought to be caused by mutations in the MITF gene. All type I and type III cases appear to be caused by PAX3 mutations leading to haploinsufficiency.
    Carezani-Gavin (1992) and Chatkupt et al., (1993) reported type I cases with a meningomyelocele - Splotch mice also have this association. Hol et al., (1995) reported a PAX3 mutation in a girl with this association. Nye et al., (1998) reported two cases with features of Waardenburg assoicted with neural tube defects who had an interstitial deletion around 2q35. Zlotogora et al., (1995) reported a child who was shown to be homozygous for a PAX3 mutation. Both parents had Waardenburg syndrome type I. There was significant dystopia canthorum, partial albinism, and marked contractures and muscle atrophy of the upper limbs, however there was no neural tube defect. The phenotype resembled severe Klein-Waardenburg syndrome (qv). Ayme and Philip (1995) also reported a fetus apparently homozygous for type 1 Waardenburg Syndrome. There were multiple joint contractures with pterygia. Exencephaly was present, the nose was hypoplastic, the upper lip notched and the neck webbed. Radiographs showed complete disorganisation of the spine. 
    Goodman et al., (1988) reported a case with absence of the vagina and a hemiuterus.
    There may be a more severe autosomal recessive type associated with Hirschsprung disease. 
    Pierpont et al., (1995) reported a dominant family where the proband had cleft lip and palate, Hirschsprung disease, and features of type I Waardenburg syndrome. The mother had features of the syndrome and her maternal uncle was reported to have a white forelock and heterochromia iridis. The gene was not apparently linked to PAX3.
     Edery et al (1996), and Hofstra et al (1996), demonstrated homozygous mutations in the endothelin-3 gene in patients with Waardenburg syndrome associated with Hirschsprung disease.
    Occasional families have been reported with the association of ocular albinism. Morell et al., (1997) studied a family with phenotypic features of Waardenburg type 2 where some individuals also have ocular albinism. The individuals with ocular albinism were found to be either heterozygous or homozygous for a polymorphism in the TYR gene leading to reduced tyrosinase activity. There was also an 1 bp deletion in exon 8 of the MITF gene in affected individuals. The authors suggested that this was an example of digenic inheritance. Read and Newton (1997) provide a good review of the molecular and clinical aspects of the condition.
    Carey et al., (1998) reported a case with features of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 together with Septo-optic dysplasia. A mutation in exon 7 of the PAX3 gene was demonstrated. Other members of the family with the same mutation did not have the septo-optic dysplasia.</abstract>

    >The best handle is the nasal configuration. It is flat with an absence of the normal nasofrontal angle. The philtrum is poorly developed and the maxilla is short. Because of this all patients have a relative prognathism. Most cases are sporadic but occasional dominant families have been reported. It is becoming apparent that many cases of 'Binder' syndrome have a mild form of chondrodysplasia punctata, so that a skeletal survey can be helpful (Sheffield et al., 1976, 1991) (see Brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata).
    Howe et al., (1995) reported six children who were exposed to phenytoin during pregnancy. They had facial features of Binder syndrome. The authors suggested that this was due to anticonvulsant-induced vitamin K deficiency and recommended vitamin K supplementation in at-risk pregnancies. The mother and son reported by Roy-Doray et al., (1997) are difficult to evaluate. The son had a small penis and the diagnosis might be Robinow syndrome.</abstract>

    >    This is not a single etiological category in that it has been associated with maternal diabetes, fetal constraint, autosomal dominant inheritance and unknown etiology. The typical facial features include a short upturned nose, a long philtrum, a thin upper lip, a small jaw and a cleft palate. There might be an upward slant of the palpebral fissures. The femora are mostly bilaterally affected and they are short with lateral bowing. The defect is usually asymmetrical. Baraitser et al., (1994) pointed out that preaxial polydactyly of the toes might be a feature of the condition. They reported two cases - in one the mother was diabetic. Sabry et al., (1996) reported a somewhat similar, but more severely affected, case with hypoplastic tibiae. There has been only one report in which a father and daughter were affected (Lampert, 1980). Robinow et al., (1995) reported a case, said to be caused by dominant inheritance, although other family members just had short stature apart from a paternal uncle who died at 4 years of age of pneumonia and had a cleft palate.
    Gillerot et al., (1997)  reported a possible case with brain abnormalities. There was agenesis of the posterior part of the corpus callosum with striking dilatations of the lateral ventricles. There was also evidence of a neuronal migration defect with a number of heterotopias. The right ulnar head was dislocated. </abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >    Infants exposed to warfarin in utero have a characteristic phenotype that is similar to chondrodysplasia punctata. The mid-face is hypoplastic, there is hypertelorism and the nose small with anteverted nares and a depressed bridge. Radiographs reveal stippling of the unossified epiphyses. Rhizomelia and scoliosis may be present. Other common abnormalities include congenital heart defects and hypoplastic nails. Cleft palate, cataract, microphthalmos (Wong et al., 1993), encephalocele, Dandy-Walker malformation (Kaplan, 1985), diaphragmatic hernia (Normann and Pedersen, 1989) and urinary tract abnormalities (Hall, 1989) have all been reported. Dextrocardia and situs inversus (Barker et al., 1994) and asplenia (Cox et al., 1977) have been reported. Howe et al., (1997) reported a case with severe angular kyphosis around the 4th cervical vertebrae with softening and secondary syringomyelia of the cervical spinal cord.
    A review of infants exposed to warfarin during pregnancy suggested that 1 in 6 may show signs of the embryopathy and of these a significant number were mentally retarded; 1 in 6 pregnancies may end in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth (Hall, 1980). Exposure in the second or third trimesters can result in severe cerebral abnormalities, probably secondary to haemorrhage. However, Wong et al., (1993) found that in a series of 29 cases (11 of who were also exposed to heparin) major complications were rare (apart from fetal loss) and the main problems were nasal hypoplasia and low birthweight.
    Franco et al., (1995) isolated three adjacent genes with homology to the sulphatase family. Point mutations were found in one of these genes in five patients with X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata. The gene was labelled arylsulphatase E (ARSE). This sulphatase is inhibited by warfarin, and it was suggested that this explains the fetal warfarin phenotype. However note that Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency (qv) also gives this phenotype, and depressed levels of fetal vitamin K is perhaps a more likely explanation.

    >    This condition is due to a deficiency of alpha-fucosidase, resulting in the accumulation of fucose containing poly- and oligosaccarides and glycolipids in many tissues. The condition is said to be more common in the Mexican and Italian populations. It has been divided into types I and II on the basis that type I has an onset in infancy, death before 3-5 years and a marked enzyme defiency, whereas type II has a partial enzyme defiency with survival into adulthood. There have, however, been reports of a severe deficiency with long survival. Angiokeratomas, said to be typical of type II, do not always develop. The other features are the development of a coarse facial appearance, short stature and mild mental retardation. Gordon et al.,  (1995) reported a 7 year old child who could not walk or talk and was experiencing increasing problems with feeding. He had dystonia of both lower limbs. Rosenthal fibres may be found in the brain at autopsy. Mutations have been found in the alpha-L-fucosidase gene (Seo et al., 1993; Williamson et al., 1993; Seo et al., 1994; Cragg et al., 1997; Willems et al., 1999).</abstract>

    >A characteristic facial appearance, prenatal growth retardation and asymmetry of the limbs are the main features of this condition. The head circumference is relatively normal, which gives the impression of 'pseudohydrocephalus'. The face is small and triangular with frontal bossing, blue sclerae, thin lips with downturned corners, and micrognathia. Minor abnormalities include increased sweating, clinodactyly of the 5th fingers and cafe au lait patches. Intelligence has been thought to be normal, however Lai et al., (1994) studied 25 cases in detail and found that 32% had an IQ below 70 and 40% were reading at least 24 months below their chronological age. The average IQ was 86. 
    Most cases are sporadic - although there is a possibility that this syndrome is autosomal dominant in some families (Duncan et al., 1990; Zanchetta et al., 1990) many of the cases in these reports do not have classical features. Possibly affected sibs have also been reported (Callaghan, 1970; Robichaux et al., 1981; Teebi, 1992). Bailey et al., (1995) reported monozygous twins where one had some features of the condition. Two other sets of discordant monozygotic twins from the literature were reviewed (Nyhan and Sakati, 1977; Samn et al., 1990). 
    Ramirez-Duenas et al., (1992) reported an 8-year-old girl with the condition who had a paternally derived (17;20)(q25;q13) apparently balanced translocation. Midro et al., (1993) also reported a possible case with a balanced 1;17 translocation with a breakpoint at 17q25.3. Eggermann et al., (1998) reported a case with a paternally derived 17q22-q24 deletion where the chorionic somatomammotrophin hormone 1 (CSH1 gene) was deleted. Tamura et al., (1993) reported a possible case with a ring chromosome 15 who was deleted for insulin-like growth factor 1receptor gene (IGFIR). Rogan et al., (1996) also noted similarities to the Russell-Silver phenotype in ring 15 cases but found no evidence of chromosome 15 deletion or disomy in five classical Russell-Silver cases. However Abu-Amero et al., (1997) found no evidence for hemizygousity of the IGFIR gene in 33 cases of Russell-Silver syndrome. Schinzel et al., (1994) reported a girl with an 8q11-q13 deletion and some features of the syndrome.
    Kotzot et al., (1995) studied 35 patients with either the Russell-Silver syndrome or primordial growth retardation. They found maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 7 in four (three with isodisomy). Preece et al., (1997) reported three cases with maternal UPD for chromosome 7 out of 37 families studied. Unfortunately no clinical photographs were published. Miyoshi et al., (1999) reported a child with a maternal UPD for part of chromosome 7 secondary to a paternal ring 7 chromosome. This appeared to rule out the putative imprinting region form 7p13 to 7q11. Ayala-Madrigal et al., (1996) found no cases of uniparental disomy for chromosome 7, 8, 11, 17 or 20 out of seven patients studied.
    Willems et al., (1988) reported a patient with ketoaciduria and dicarboxylic aciduria who had mild hypoglycaemia and ketosis. Cazgan et al., (1994) reported four cases with metabolic abnormalities. These consisted of fasting-induced hypoglycaemia and ketonaemia. One case had dicarboxylic aciduria and elevated serum long-chain fatty acids. Alvarenga et al., (1995) reported evidence for type II renal tubular acidosis in 14 out of 33 patients.
    Stanhope et al., (1991) presented data to suggest that biosynthetic growth hormone treatment gives an initial growth response, but might not affect final height. Rakover et al., (1996) presented similar evidence of an improvement in height over three years of treatment during childrhood, but could not assess the long term benefit in adulthood. Eggermann et al., (1997) found 3 cases of uniparental disomy in 7 out of 37 cases. No evidence for uniparental disomy for chromosome 2, 9, 14 or 16 was found.</abstract>

    >Onset is usually within the first three years of life with pyrexia and bone pain. The skull enlarges and the long bones become bent and might fracture. Radiologically the skull is dense, uneven, and has round areas which resemble balls of cotton wool. The tubular bones become bowed and the bone itself has a trabecular pattern with widened medullary cavities. Extraskeletal problems occur. Angioid streaks should be looked for in the eye, and skin changes which resemble those seen in pseudoxanthoma elasticum have been reported. Alkaline phosphatase levels are raised. Calcitonin therapy has been reported to be effective (Whalen et al., (1977). Nerlich et al., (1992) reported a case with multifocal osteogenic sarcoma of the skull. </abstract>

    >As pointed out by Opitz, this autosomal dominant syndrome can be extremely variable. At birth the only features may be those of Pierre Robin association (cleft palate, micrognathia and glossoptosis). Radiological examination at this time may reveal coronal clefts of the vertebrae, mild platyspondyly and flaring of the metaphyses of the long bones (features of the Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome). As the child grows older these features become normal, although a mild epiphyseal dysplasia may develop. Harkey et al., (1989) reported a case with disc herniation causing paraplegia and Noel et al., (1992) reported cervical spinal canal stenosis leading to a Brown-Sequard syndrome. Snead and Yates (1999) provide a good review.
    The main cause of morbidity after the neonatal period is a severe myopia with the risk of retinal detachment. Thus any child with Pierre Robin association should have careful ophthalmic follow-up.
    Baraitser (1981) suggests that this syndrome is identical to Marshall syndrome, although this is still disputed by Ayme and Preus (1984).
    Francomano et al., (1987), Knowlton et al., (1989) and Priestley et al., (1990) reported close linkage to COL2A1 in several families. COL2A1 mutations have been reported in some families, including the original Stickler kindred (Williams et al., 1996).  Vintiner et al., (1991) studied six families with the COL2A1 probe and showed that two were not linked to this locus. In one family the disease co-segregated with a balanced 5;17 translocation in four individuals, suggesting a separate locus at one of these breakpoints. Fryer et al., (1990) and Bonaventure et al., (1992) also reported families where the gene did not appear to be linked to COL2A1. Brunner et al., (1994) found evidence for linkage to 6p22-p21.3, close to the COL11A2 gene, in a large Dutch kindred. Vikkula et al., (1995) then found a splice donor site mutation resulting in in-frame exon skipping in the COL11A2 gene in this family. They also found a glycine to arginine substitution in the gene in a family with a more severe recessive form of Stickler syndrome. Families mapping to the COL11A2 gene do not appear to have eye abnormalities (Sirko-Osadsa et al.,1998), and this is thought to be because in mammalian vitreous the COL5A2 product replaces the alpha2 chain of type XI collagen. It is of interest that Richards et al., (1996) found a mutation in the COL11A1 gene in a family segregating for Stickler syndrome with vitreous and retinal abnormalities. Griffith et al., (1998) reported a family with the Marshall syndrome phenotype and demonstrated a mutation in the COL11A1 locus. See the comments by Shanske et al., (1998) and Warman et al., (1998).
    It is of interest that some autosomal dominant families segregating for early onset primary osteoarthritis associated with a mild chondrodysplasia also show linkage to, or mutations in, the COL2A1 gene (Palotie et al., 1989; Knowlton et al., 1990; Ala-Kokko et al., 1990; Katzenstein et al., 1990; Eyre et al., 1991; Vikkula et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1993; Pun et al., 1994; Ritvaniemi et al., 1994; Winterpacht et al., 1994; Bleasel et al., 1996). However Meulenbelt et al., (1997) could not find linkage to several collagen loci in a dominant family segregating for osteoarthritis without bone dysplasia.
    Ahmad et al., (1991) and (1993) reported mutations of the COL2A1 gene leading to a premature stop codon in two separate families. Bleasal et al., (1995) reported two cases with tall stature, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and early osteoarthritis with COL2A1 mutations. They may well have had Stickler syndrome but the case report is inadequate.
    The condition is sometimes called Wagner-Stickler syndrome. Wagner (1938) reported individuals with a form of erosive vitreo-retinopathy who showed ophthalmological similarities to the COL2A1-linked form of Stickler syndrome. In Wagner disease rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are uncommon and retinal pigment epithelial changes, poor night vision, visual field defects, and abnormal ERG findings are found. Furthermore the locus maps to 5q13-14 (Brown et al., 1995). Korkko et al., (1993) reported three patients with the Wagner phenotype who had COL2A1 mutations, but Brown et al., (1995) considered that the diagnosis in these cases was most likely Stickler syndrome, especially since radiographs were not examined.
    Ballo et al., (1998) reported a mother and three children with a dominant negative mutation of the COL2A1 gene with features of Stickler syndrome, but also with brachydactyly.
    Pihlajamaa et al., (1998) demonstrated a mutation in the COL11A2 gene in the patient originally described as having Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (qv) (Weissenbacher and Zweymuller 1964). This would suggest that the Weissenbacher-Zweymuller phenotype can be part of OSMED syndrome.  </abstract>

    >GENERAL
    This common autosomal dominant condition occurs in about 1 in 3000 individuals. The manifestations are protean and well known. The most common presenting features are cafe au lait patches (more than six greater than 1.5 cms in diameter) and peripheral neurofibromata. Fois et al., (1993) investigated the diagnostic significance of cafe au lait spots. Of children ascertained with typical cafe au lait spots of significant number, 57% went on to develop definite NF1 and in the remainder of the patients the diagnosis was highly likely. Goldberg et al., (1996) provide an extensive review of the clinical features. Cnossen et al., (1998) studied the value of minor disease features in making the diagnosis in children under six years. They provided evidence suggesting that macrocephaly, short stature, hypertelorism, and thorax abnormalities (pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum) were significantly more common in children with NF1 in this age group.
    Complications can include plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid, macrocephaly, short stature, scoliosis, pseudarthrosis of the tibia (Stevenson et al., 1999), hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, phaeochromocytoma, neurofibrosarcomas, meningiomas, and acoustic neuromas. The latter may be confined to the so-called central form of the disease (type 2 - see separate entry). Plexiform neurofibromas occur in about 28% of cases but cause severe cosmetic problems in about 1% of cases. They are usually present in the first year of life but can progress to marked overgrowth. Dugoff and Sujansky (1996) found that during pregnancy 50-60% of women reported growth of new neurofibromas or enlargement of existing neurofibromas.  Listernick et al., (1994) found optic pathway tumours in 20% of affected children, however in only 10% of these was there evidence of tumour growth or deteriorating vision.  Optic nerve gliomas may be associated with glaucoma.  Subtle ocular signs of the disorder include Lisch nodules of the iris. Curless et al., (1998) suggest that there are characteristic MRI findings (high signal changes on T2-weighted images, sometimes also seen in T1-weighted images. These authors suggest that these findings may be enough to establish a diagnosis of NF1 in a patient with optic nerve glioma in the absence of cafe au lait spots. 
    There is an increased tendency to leukaemias, particularly of the myeloproliferative form (Bader et al., 1978, Brodeur et al., 1994, Lichtman et al., 1994, Shannon et al., 1994). Bollag et al., (1996) suggested that neurofibromin negatively regulates granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) through Ras. An association between NF1, juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia and juvenile xanthogranulomas has been noted.  Zvulunov et al., (1995) review the literature and conclude that this is a true association. Infants with this combination have a higher instance of family history of NF1. The authors suggest that the combination of NF1 and juvenile xanthogranuloma carries a 20-32-fold higher risk for juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia. Saenger (1998) discusses the risk of tumours developing in children given growth hormone for growth deficiency in NF1. Risks seem to be low, but caution is still advised. 
    Sutphen et al., (1995) reported four cases with clitoral hypertrophy, but with normal endocrinological studies. They found 26 cases with this association in the literature. Habiby et al., (1995) found seven cases with precocious puberty out of 219 children with NF1. All had optic pathway tumours and the incidence of precocious puberty amongst cases with this complication was 39%. However, Zacharin (1997) reported two children with precocious puberty without optic chiasmal gliomas. Cnossen et al., (1997) also stress that this was not a necessary association.
    About 5% of gene carriers may have mild mental retardation (Legius et al., 1994), and a third have serious complications at some stage during their life. Friedman and Birch (1997) provide a good review of 1,728 registered cases, with a useful estimate  of the incidence of different complications in the condition. Another good population review is provided by McGaughran et al., (1999).  
UNUSUAL CASES
    Clausen et al., (1989) reported a family where a mother had ganglioneuromas, two daughters had neuroblastomas and a son had neurofibromatosis, as did one of the mother's brothers. Other family members had Hirschsprung disease.
    Schotland et al., (1992) reported a family where four members had both features of NF-1 and osseous fibrous dysplasia - they reviewed other cases from the literature with this combination.
    Chang et al., (1993) reported two cases where neurofibromatosis type 1 was associated with piebaldism.
    Poyhonen et al., (1997) reported a family where 7 individuals in 3 generations had spinal neurofibromatosis. All patients had cafe au lait spots but none had Lisch nodules. Linkage studies showed that the disorder was likely to be allelic with NF1. Ars et al., (1998) reported a family with spinal neurofibromatosis where a frameshift mutation in the NF1 gene was found.
GENETICS
    The gene has been localised to 17q22. It is 350kb in length with an 11-13kb transcript. The protein, neurofibromin, appears to be a GTPase activating protein (GAP) (Wallace et al., 1990; Cawthon et al., 1990). Lazaro et al., (1994) demonstrated germline mosaicism in a clinically normal father. Kayes et al., (1994), Wu et al., (1995), Wu et al., (1997) and Upadhyaya et al., (1998) report deletions giving a more severe phenotype including significant retardation and some facial features of Noonan syndrome. One case had iris colobomas. Lazaro et al., (1995) demonstrated germline mosaicism for a 12-kb deletion in the NF1 gene in an unaffected father who had two affected children. Riva et al., (1996) reported a case with a 17q11.2 deletion who had NF1 as well as skeletal anomalies consisting of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, bilateral dislocation of the hip. However Tongard et al., (1997) presented evidence suggesting that the presence of deletions could not be predicted with certainty on the basis of the clinical phenotype.
    Upadhyaya et al., (1994) and Shen et al., (1995) review the range of mutations in this condition.  Colam et al., (1996) reported a case shown to be mosiac for a deletion of most of the coding region of the gene.  The phenotype, however, was not 'segmental'.
    Heim et al., (1995) studied 21 NF1 cases using a protein truncation assay and found truncating deletions in 14 individuals. Rasmussen et al., (1998) studied 67 probands and found large mutations in 5 (7.5%). They did not find an increased severity of disease manifestations in these cases. Park and Pivnick (1998) used a protein truncation test to screen 15 patients and found mutations in 11 (73%). 
    Van Asperen et al., (1998) reported a mother and son with NF1 who both had an overgrowth syndrome resembling Weaver syndrome. They were shown to have a large deletion of 17q11.2  encompassing the entire NF1 gene.</abstract>

    >    The features which help to distinguish this form of short rib-polydactyly are a midline cleft of the upper lip and relatively normal pelvic and long bones, apart from the tibiae, which have a characteristic oval shape. Affected infants may also have ambiguous genitalia and do not survive the neonatal period. The differential diagnosis includes Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome and Mohr-Majewski compound. Indeed, all these syndrome have been reported to have similar cardiac defects, in particular atrioventricular canal defect (Digilio et al., 1997) Sharma et al., (1992) reported two unrelated fetuses with suggested overlap with hydrolethalus syndrome. Glomerylocystic disease of the kidney can be a feature (Montemarano et al., 1995).
    Prudlo et al., (1993) review the neuropathological features of the condition. These include cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, arachnoid cysts in the posterior cranial fossa, agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and pachygyria or neuronal heterotopia. Majewski et al., (1971) also reported a case with arhinencephaly. Prudlo et al., (1993) reported CNS abnormalities in a possible case of Majewski syndrome. These included narrowing of the corpus callosum, dilated ventricles, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia with an arachnoid cyst between the cerebellar hemispheres. There was also evidence of heterotopia. These authors review the incidence of CNS abnormalities in the literature, including pachygyria and arhinencephaly. Martinez-Frias et al., (1993) also reported CNS abnormalities in two cases with some features of Majewski syndrome (although with overlap with other short rib-polydactyly syndromes). One case had anencephaly and the other had arhinencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, agenesis of the cerebellum and hydrocephalus.
    Urioste et al., (1994) reported a possible case with tongue hamartomata and situs inversus. The baby had a pericentric inversion of chromosome 4 (p16q21). The mother was found to have the same inversion.</abstract>

    >This craniotubular bone dysplasia is characterised by sclerosis of the skull, which includes the vault and the base, combined with abnormal metaphyseal modelling of the long bones. The initial symptoms are often progressive nasal obstruction and mouth breathing in childhood. In familial cases the facial distortion might be the earliest complaint. Clinically there is broadening  of the nasal base with paranasal bossing, telecanthus and a prominence of the facial bones, especially the jaw.  Bilateral facial weakness and progressive deafness might be other childhood signs. Intelligence is usually normal. Richards et al., (1996) reported surgical management of the craniofacial abnormalities. Most families have shown autosomal dominant inheritance although autosomal recessive inheritance has been occasionally observed, (Penchaszadeh et al., 1980; Tinschert and Braun 1998). The main differential diagnosis is craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. Elcioglu and Hall (1998) provide a follow up of an autosomal recessive case.
    Nurnberg et al., (1997) mapped the gene to 5p14.1-p15.2 in a dominant family.</abstract>

    >    Majewski et al., (1985) reported 34 affected individuals from six families with tibial aplasia and a split hand/foot deformity. 99 familial cases were reviewed from the literature. Expression appeared to be variable with some cases manifesting with only hypoplastic great toes and the most severe cases having transverse hemimelia of all four limbs. Some cases had hypoplastic ulnae, bifurcation of the femurs, absent patellae or postaxial polydactyly. Cup-shaped ears appear to be a further manifestation of the condition. 
    The relationship of this condition to that described under Gollop (1980) (qv) is uncertain, but they could be the same. 
    Kohn et al., (1989) described two consanguineous families in each of which two sisters were affected. In one girl the upper limbs were entirely normal, but both legs were affected with bifurcated femurs, absent tibiae, and oligodactyly of the toes. In the other sister the upper limbs were also normal and the left leg also appeared normal, apart from tridactylous ectrodactyly. Kohn et al., (1989) point out that the genetics of this conditon is heterogeneous with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive families being likely.  Majewski et al., (1996) further discuss the inheritance and suggest that manifestation in putative recessive families does not differ from dominant families.
    Sener et al., (1990) reported a family where the proband had bilateral aplasia of the tibia, radius and ulna with hypoplasia of the femur, fibula and humerus, tetra-oligodactyly and marked hypoplasia of the iliac wings, however other family members were reported as having milder abnormalities.
    Zlotogora (1994) analysed families where split hand/foot was associated with other limb abnormalities and found that penetrance was 66%, with several skipped generations in some families.
    Nunes et al., (1995) reported a fetus with split foot associated with \hemimelia of the right lower extremity\ and left preaxial polydactyly of the toes. They also demonstrated linkage to 10q25 markers in a family segregating for isolated split hand/split foot.</abstract>

    >This condition may be the same as the Naumoff form of short rib-polydactyly syndrome (type III) according to Sillence (1980). Urogenital and anorectal abnormalities are common including imperforate anus, vaginal atresia, urethrovaginal fistula, persistent cloaca and ureteral atresia. Many  cases have a congenital heart defect. Radiographs reveal that the base of the ilium is hypoplastic and that the vertebrae are rounded, sometimes with coronal clefts. The ends of the long bones are either pointed or have a convex central area of ossification with lateral metaphyseal spikes. Hill and Leary (1998) reported prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography at 13 weeks of pregnancy.</abstract>

    >This autosomal dominant condition is characterised by frontal and parietal bossing, a persistent open anterior fontanelle, often with late closure of the other sutures (including the metopic suture), small facial bones, hypertelorism and delayed eruption of the dentition with supernumerary teeth. The clavicles are either absent or severely hypoplastic, and the most serious manifestation is the occasional occurrence of a severe scoliosis. Other radiological features include wormian bones, thickening of the calvarium (especially over the occiput), a narrow thorax, hypoplasia of the iliac wings, and failure of fusion of the symphysis pubis. Occasionally there are short distal phalanges in the hands. There are rare cases on record of possible autosomal recessive inheritance. (Goodman et al., 1975). Zackai et al., (1997) reported sibs where it was suggested that germ line mosaicism was present in one parent.
    Brueton et al., (1992) reported three apparent cases with re-arrangements of 8q22. A mother and daughter had a balanced t(8;10)(q22.3;p12.3) and an isolated girl had a dup(8q13.3-&lt;q22.1). Nienhaus et al., (1993) reported a 22-year-old man with apparent cleidocranial dysostosis and mild to moderate mental retardation. He had a 46,XY,inv(6)(p11q16) karyotype, which was not present in his mother. His deceased father could not be tested. Narahara et al., (1995) reported a case with a balanced 6p12;18q24 translocation. Parental chromosomes could not be examined.
    Mundlos et al., (1995) mapped the gene to 6p21 in three families. Feldman et al., (1995) and Ramesar et al., (1996) confirmed this mapping and Gelb et al., (1995) refined it and reported a case with a microdeletion. Lee et al., (1997), Otto et al., (1997), Mundlos et al., (1997) demonstrated missense mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor OSF2/CBFA1. Rodan et al., (1997) and Dickman (1997) provide reviews of mutations  in both the mouse and the man.
    Mundlos (1999) provides a good review of the clinical and genetic situation.</abstract>

    >The cardinal features are the presence at birth of a severe Pierre Robin sequence (a very small jaw, a U-shaped cleft palate and glossoptosis), posterior rib gaps, and mental retardation in about half of those who survive. Early death occurs in 40% of cases, due mainly to respiratory difficulties. Microcephaly occurs in only 20% of cases, and the small number of post mortems so far carried out have shown cerebral heterotopia and focal gliosis, but this is not constant. Survivors are short, have epicanthic folds, and the rib gaps might heal partially and give rise to pseudoarthroses. Ibba et al., (1997) reported a case diagnosed by ultrasound at prenatal diagnosis. There was increased nuchal transluceny at 11 weeks and micrognathia was noted at 12 weeks with failure to identify the ribs at 18 weeks. Plotz et al., (1996) provide a good review.
    Affected sibs with apparently normal parents have been reported (Hennekam et al., (1985); Drossou-Agakidou et al., 1991). However, there is also a dominantly inherited form of cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome which has speech delay, but a normal head circumference and a normal IQ (Leroy et al., 1981; Merlob et al., 1987). In general the two types cannot be distinguished clinically. In isolated cases the parents must be X-rayed. Hennekam and Goldschmeding (1998) reported a female infant born at 34 weeks with a very severe form of the condition. There was total absence of ossification of the ribs,  extreme micrognathia and also absence of the external auditory meati and inner ears. The authors suggest that the Myf5 and MyoD genes are candidates for this condition. Goosecoid is also a candidate.
    Van den Ende et al., (1998) reported seven patients with the condition. One 12 year old boy (previously reported by Meinecke et al., 1987 and Schrander-Stumpel et al., 1996) attended a normal school but had bilateral hearing loss. A 36 year old female had normal psychodevelopment although her 14 month old daughter was affected and suffered severe perinatal asphyxia resulting in encephalopathy with cortical atrophy and convulsions. A 14 year old girl had normal psychomotor development. Previously unreported features including absence of auditory canal and subluxation of the radial head in one case and choanal atresia in another. Kirk and Ades (1998) reported a case with a hypoplastic left heart</abstract>

The clinical findings in both patients were low birth weight, a narrow chest and micromelia.  It is characterized radiologically by very short ribs, marked platyspondyly with wide interpedicular distances in the lumbar region and short triangular-shaped humeri which taper distally. Other features include over-modelled long bones, flared metaphyses and constricted diaphyses. In the pelvis the iliac bones had a reduced height and were concave inferiorly with irregular iliac crests.</abstract>

    >    This entity has been included separately because of the uncertainty of its relationship to Caffey disease with postnatal onset. As well as severe cortical hyperostosis, manifestations of the prenatal form include bowing of the long bones, pulmonary hypoplasia, hepatomegaly and stillbirth or early death. Lecolier et al., (1992) reported a case and provided a good review of the literature. Turnpenny et al., (1993) reported three cases, including two sibs. One of their cases had somewhat coarse facies and wormian bones. De Jong and Muller (1995) and Drinkwater et al., (1997) also reported affected sibs. 
    I-cell disease and GM1 gangliosidosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Note that the case reported by Kozlowski and Tsuruta (1989) may represent a separate condition, as may Raine (1989) (qv).

    >A rare form of bone dysplasia that resembles Kniest dysplasia, this condition gets its name from the Greek for changing pattern; short-limbed dwarfism is present at birth but the back gradually becomes shorter with age. The joints are prominent, the chest narrow and there may be a caudal appendage overlying the sacrum. Radiographs reveal flaring of the metaphyses with flattened deformed epiphyses. The ribs are short with flaring and cupping of the anterior borders. The vertebrae become flattened with age with a characteristic anterior tongue of bone on lateral view. The fingers and toes may be very long. Severe kyphosis develops. It has been suggested that inheritance is autosomal recessive (Beck et al., 1983), but a dominant form seems to exist and 'recessive' cases could be caused by parental mosaicism. There is a variation in severity and a neonatal lethal form has been described (Kozlowski et al., 1976; Shanske et al., 1982) - however this needs to be carefully differentiated from fibrochondrogenesis (qv).</abstract>

    >    There is progressive overgrowth of bone affecting all areas of the skull and face (including the mandible). Stature is often normal, but mental retardation can be a feature. Clinically the initial feature is often the progressive facial distortion, especially around the nose. Later, optic atrophy and deafness might develop. Radiologically the skull is thick (all areas are involved) and the sinuses and nasal passages might be obscured. In the spine the neural arches are sometimes sclerotic and there is diaphyseal thickening of the long bones. Richards et al., (1996) reported surgical management of the craniofacial abnormalities. 
    The genetics of the condition is not entirely certain. The sib pair reported by de Souza (1927) may have had Van Buchem's disease. Halliday (1949) reported a possible case where there was parental consanguinity. Schaefer et al., (1986) reported an affected mother and son where there was overlap with craniometaphyseal dysplasia. This family is described as a separate entity in the database.</abstract>

    >This mental retardation syndrome is characterised clinically by low birth-weight in the majority, short stature, microcephaly, and generalised hirsutism resulting in synophrys, a hairy forehead, hairy ears and marked hair whorls on the posterior trunk and arms. The nose is short, the nostrils anteverted and flared, and there is a long philtrum and a thin upper lip with a midline beak. Feeding difficulties, irritability, a deep hoarse cry, and increased tone in the limbs are common early problems. Upper limb defects are common and vary from proximally placed thumbs to absence deformities and ectrodactyly (Braddock et al., 1993). Thrombocytopenia may also be a rare finding (Froster and Gortner, 1993; Fryns and Vinken, 1994). Ozkinay et al., (1998) reported a case with vermis hypoplasia. Hayashi et al., (1996) reported a case with septo-optic dysplasia and cerebellar hypoplasia. Extensive reviews of the condition are to be found in the reports of papers from the 12th Annual David W. Smith Workshop (Graham, 1993).
    Kliewer et al., (1993) provide valuable data on fetal growth derived from ultrasound studies. Limb defects might be picked up in utero, and in addition diaphragmatic hernia appears to be relatively common (Cunniff et al., 1993).
    The phenotype is variable but the condition should be diagnosed with extreme caution in those who are not mentally handicapped. The existence of a milder form of the condition, sometimes with autosomal dominant inheritance, is still controversial. de Die-Smulders et al., (1992) reported a moderately retarded boy with the condition whose mother had normal intelligence, but had convincing facial features of the condition. de Die-Smulders et al., (1994) suggested that transmission of mild de Lange syndrome was exclusively maternal. However, Chodirker and Chudley (1994) reported a convincingly affected father and son. Mckenney et al., (1996) reported convincingly affected half sibs with a common father. Less convincing was their suggestion that the father was affected. Other 'dominant' cases cited from the literature are less convincing (eg: Bankier et al., 1986; Kumar et al., 1985; Leavitt et al., 1985; Kozma 1996). Baraitser and Papavasiliou (1993) reported MZ twins who possibly had the mild form of the condition. Further cases with mild features, and valuable discussion of this phenotype can be found in Bay et al., (1993), Moeschler and Graham (1993), Clericuzio (1993), Saal et al., (1993) and Saul et al., (1993). Allanson et al., (1997) discuss the use of facial measurements to diagnose both the classical and mild forms.
     Concordance in monozygotic twins and affected sibs with the classic form have occasionally been reported (see Fryns et al., 1987 and Krajewska-Walasek et al., 1995) but most cases are sporadic. Carakushansky et al., (1996) reported discordant DNA fingerprint-proven monozygotic female twins. Ireland et al., (1991) reported a convincing case with a 3q26:17q23 de novo translocation. Children with duplication of 3q also show some features of de Lange syndrome. Holder et al., (1994) reported two children with features of mild de Lange syndrome and a distal duplication of 3q25.1-26.2 as a result of an unbalanced translocation involving chromosomes 3 and 10. Ireland et al., (1995) showed that the duplicated band was in fact 3q26.3, which was also involved in their translocation case (Ireland et al., 1991). However, Shaffer et al., (1993) failed to find evidence of uniparental disomy for chromosome 3 in sixteen cases of de Lange syndrome, nor Marchi et al., (1994) in 26 cases.
    Melegh et al., (1996) reported a case with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and persistent hyperthermia, however no clinical photographs were published.</abstract>

    >Strictly speaking Bardet-Biedl is separate from Laurence-Moon syndrome (qv). The difference is that patients with Laurence-Moon syndrome are spastic, thin and do not have polydactyly. Both conditions present with retinal dystrophy, mental handicap and hypogenitalism. Bardet-Biedl syndrome, the commoner of the two, is variable in its manifestations. 70% of cases have post-axial polydactyly which, when present, might only affect one limb. Beales et al., (1999) provide diagnostic criteria. Manouvrier-Hanu et al., (1999) reported a rare case with features of the condition who had preaxial polydactyly. Syndactyly and brachydactyly are very common (Green et al., 1989). Rudling et al., (1996) studied the radiological features in 43 cases and noted that a short middle phalanx of the 5th digit was common and that either a long or short styloid of the ulna with the appearance of Madelung deformity in some cases was present in 5-10%. Beales et al., (1999) present evidence suggesting that heterozygotes are predisposed to renal malformation and renal cell carcinoma.
    Renal problems are common and might be present in 90% of cases when looked for (Harnett et al., 1988). Abnormalities include calyceal clubbing, cysts or diverticulae, fetal lobulations, renal cortical loss and a reduced ability to concentrate urine - renal failure can occur. There may also be renal dysplasia. The picture can be that of juvenile nephronophthisis. O'Dea et al., (1996) studied 38 patients and found that 25% developed renal impairment by the age of 48 years but abnormalities on renal imaging were present in 96% of patients. Urogenital abnormalities are also common in females. These include vaginal atresia, septate vaginas, ectopic urethras, and hypoplasia or duplication of the uterus and fallopian tubes (Stoler et al., 1995; Mehrotra et al., 1997). David et al., (1999) reported nine female infants presenting with vaginal atresia and post-axial polydactyly who were initially diagnosed as having Kaufman-McKusick syndrome, but who later developed obesity and retinal dystrophy indicating a diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Hirschsprung disease and anal atresia are rare associations (Islek et al., 1996). Situs inversus has also occasionally been reported (Lorda-Sanchez et al., 1999). 
    Elbedour et al., (1994) studied 22 cases from three inbred Bedouin families with echocardiography. They found abnormalities in seven of these cases. One case had a dilated cardiomyopathy, two cases thickening of the interventricular septum, one case a bicuspid aortic valve and one case each of mild pulmonary valve stenosis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The sibs reported by McLoughlin et al., (1964) with heart defects most likely had Carpenter syndrome. 
    Mental retardation might not always be present. Green et al., (1989) found this in 41% of cases. Other abnormalities include obesity (90%), diabetes mellitus (50%), hypogonadism in males (88%) and menstrual problems in females (100%) (Green et al., 1989). Two patients in the report by Green et al., (1989) had vaginal atresia. In general four of the five major manifestations are necessary for a positive diagnosis. 
    Visual abnormalities characteristically consist of an atypical pigmentary retinopathy with early macular involvement. Electrophysiological studies reveal a cone-rod dystrophy. Onset of visual impairment is in the second and third decade and in one study 63.6% of patients were legally blind by the age of 20 years (reviewed by Campo and Aaberg, (1982) and Fulton et al., (1993) - see also Green et al., (1989)). Other ophthalmological abnormalities include myopia, astigmatism, nystagmus, glaucoma and cataracts (Green et al., 1989). 
    Riise (1996) studied the cause of death in 14 patients.  Average age at death was 43 years in males and 46.4 years in females.  The cause was mainly renal disease or myocardial infarction.  
    Diaz et al., (1991) reported a possibly affected 9-year-old boy with a hypothalamic hamartoma, suggesting overlap with the Pallister-Hall syndrome.
    Kwitek-Black et al., (1993) found linkage to markers at 16q13-q22 in a large inbred Bedouin family. However in a second family linkage was excluded, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Leppert et al., (1994) showed linkage to markers at 11q13 in some families. Sheffield et al., (1994) demonstrated linkage to markers at 3p11-p13 in a further large inbred Bedouin kindred. Yet another locus was identified in a highly inbred Bedouin kindred, mapping to 15q22 (Carmi et al., 1995). Carmi et al., (1995) presented evidence suggesting that alleles at the different loci may cause slightly different phenotypic effects.  They suggested that chromosome 3 associated cases have polydactyly of all four limbs, whilst in chromosome 15 associated cases this is mostly confined to the hands. Chromosome 16 associated cases are least inclined to obesity whereas chromosome 15 cases have early onset morbid obesity. Beales et al., (1997) studied 18 families both clinically and genetically. They found that 44% linked to 11q13 (BBS1) and 17% linked to 16q21 (BBS2). One family linked to 15q22 (BBS4) and none to 3p12(BBS3). BBS1 patients tended to be taller than their parents. BBS1 patients required less special help at school than BBS4 patients. A fifth locus was mapped to 2q31 by Young et al., (1999).
    Croft et al., (1995) found that 27% of fathers of affected children were significantly overweight compared to only 9% of the general US population. This suggested a heterozygote effect of the gene in males.</abstract>

    >Kozlowski et al., (1985) have pointed out that thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) associated with a cloverleaf skull is a separate condition from isolated TD. This may be supported by the report of affected sibs by Partington et al., (1971). In comparison with TD, the long bones are longer and are not bowed; histological changes in the cartilage are similar but not so severe. The skull changes are very unusual in that the basal and occipital bones are underdeveloped so that the parietal bones form most of the back of the skull.
    It is of interest that the first description of a cloverleaf skull by Vrolik (1849) was in an infant who probably had this condition (see illustration reproduced in Witt et al., 1992).
    Tavormina et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Sixteen out of 16 cases had a Lys650Glu substitution adjacent to an autophosphorylation site in the tyrosine kinase domain.
    Naski et al., (1996) showed that mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause a gradient of ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation in thanatophoric dysplasia, achondrogenesis and hypochondroplasia.  It should be noted that FGFR3 haploinsufficiency in the mouse results in elongation of the long bones. Wu-Chou et al., (1997) showed that mutant TDII had constitutive tryosine kinase activity which can specifically activate the transcription  factor Stat1. They also showed that the mutant  FGFR3 induced nuclear translocation of Stat1, expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 and growth arrest of the cell.
    Nguyen et al., (1997) studied calcium signaling in fibroblasts from cases with homozygous achondroplasia, heterozygous achondroplasia, TD1 and TD2, and concluded that mutant FGFR3 can function in a dosage dependent dominant-negative fashion to inactivate FGFR signaling. Wilcox et al., (1998) studied 91 cases. FGFR3 mutations were identified in every case. Cases with a Lys650Glu mutation had straight femora and  craniosynostosis. In all other cases the femora were curved and craniosynostosis was in frequent. Cases with the Tyr373Cys substitution tended to have more severe radiographic manifestations than the Arg248Cys cases, but with overlap. The data suggested that thanatophoric dysplasia could be subdivided into two groups (type I and type II), based on the presence or absence of curved femora, craniosynostosis can occur in both types,  but is more common in type II.</abstract>

    >This is the association of juvenile nephronophthisis, tapetoretinal degeneration resembling Leber's amaurosis, cone-shaped epiphyses of the hands and cerebellar ataxia. It was first described by Mainzer et al., (1970) in a brother and sister. Since that time several other sets of affected sibs have been reported. Ellis et al., (1984) reported two brothers and a sister from a consanguineous mating with the condition. These children did not have ataxia and two of them had midline pigmented nevi. Bianchi et al., (1988) described a male case with what is most likely the same condition. He had joint laxity, hypogenitalism, a retarded bone age and curved radii with a 'halbered-like' appearance to the distal end. A case resembling the one reported by Bianchi et al., (1988) was reported by Di Rocco et al., (1997). This boy had short stature due to growth hormone insufficiency. TSH secretion was also poor. He had a right ptosis and sixth nerve palsy. Retinitis pigmentosa was diagnosed at  11 years. Progressive renal failure was noted from 12 years of age due to nephronophthisis. Radiographs showed retardation of bone age, wide-spread osteopenia, epiphyseal hypoplasia, hypoplastic iliac bones with irregular acetabular margins and thin tubular bones. </abstract>

    >The main features are intrahepatic cholestasis, congenital heart disease, and skeletal and ocular anomalies. The following percentage figures are from Alagille et al., (1987). In most cases there is a paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts (occasionally extrahepatic as well) resulting in prolonged neonatal jaundice (91%), although a quarter develop jaundice later in infancy (Mueller et al., 1984). The cardiac lesions (85%) are predominantly peripheral pulmonary stenosis but might include pulmonary valve stenosis, partial anomalous venous drainage or atrial and ventricular septal defects. Various degrees of anterior chamber defect (particularly posterior embryotoxon) might occur as well as a pigmentary retinopathy (88%). Nischal et al., (1997) found that 80% of cases had optic disc drusen bilaterally and 95% of cases had drusen unilaterally.
    The skeletal changes consist of hemi or butterfly vertebrae (87%) and there may be shortening of the distal phalanges, radius or ulna. Rodriguez et al., (1991) reported a possible case with features of caudal regression. The forehead is prominent, the eyes deepset and the nose long with a flattened tip. In adulthood the mandible becomes significantly prominent. Short stature is common (50%) and there is occasional mental retardation (16%).It has been suggested that the facial features are secondary to the prolonged effects of bile duct obstruction. In general the liver abnormalities resolve with age although occasional cases can have more severe hepatic problems leading to early death. Twenty-five percent of cases need liver transplantation. Cambiaghi et al., (1998) described a child with steatocystoma multiplex and leuconychia. Krantz et al., (1997) provide a good review.
    Devriendt et al., (1996) reported a possible case who was found to have an absent kidney on one side, and developed diabetes mellitus secondary to an atrophic pancreas.  He had the typical liver features, but no heart defects or skeletal abnormalities apart from clinodactyly.
    Dhorne-Pollet et al., (1994) carried out segregation analysis on 33 families ascertained through 43 probands. They estimated that penetrance of the gene was 94%, and that 15% of cases were sporadic. The latter figure seems rather low as in only about 15% of probands was there an affected parent. Elmslie et al., (1995) studied fourteen cases and found that six appeared to have an affected parent.  
    Some cases have been shown to have a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 20 (reviewed by Teebi et al., 1992 and Krantz et al., 1997), however Desmaze et al., (1992) failed to detect microdeletions either by high resolution chromosome banding or by using in situ hybridisation. Rand et al., (1995) found a single submicroscopic deletion of chromosome 20 markers in a detailed study of 24 cytogenetically normal Alagille patients. Moog et al., (1996) reported a family where a father and two children had a duplication of 20p11.21-20p11.23 and features consistent with Alagille syndrome.
    Oda et al., (1997) and Li et al., (1997) demonstrated mutations in the Jagged 1 gene causing presumed haploinsufficiency. The Jagged1 gene encodes a ligand for the Notch receptor (Artavanis-Tsakonas 1997). Yuan et al., (1998) studied 8 families and found seven mutations (4 frameshift, one nonsense, one splice-site, and one 1.3Mb deletion). Further mutations were reported by Krantz et al., (1998).
        Krantz et al., (1999) studied a patient with tetralogy of Fallot and a butterfly vertebra, but no other features of Alagille syndrome. She was found to have a deletion of 20p12 encompassing the Jagged1 gene. Another patient with pulmonary stenosis, and a family history of this condition, was also found to have a mutation of the Jagged1 gene although there were no other feautres of Alagille syndrome.</abstract>

    >CLINICAL
    In its classical form this progressive neurological disorder is characterised in infancy by sun-sensitivity, resulting in bullae and desquamation of the skin. The characteristic facial appearance does not develop until between the 2nd and 4th years. There is a loss of subcutaneous tissue around the eyes, giving the appearance of premature ageing. The head circumference at this stage is small, as is length, and a sensorineural hearing loss is common. Both central and peripheral demyelination results in loss of skills, and features of a neuropathy, although limb reflexes (at the knee especially) can be exaggerated. A retinopathy occurs late and may be accompanied by optic atrophy. Pericapillary calcification in the cortex and in the basal ganglia is a common feature. Nance and Berry (1992) provide an excellent review.
CHROMOSOMAL/DNA REPAIR DEFECTS
    Chromosome breakage is seen on exposure of cells to UV light. Unlike in xeroderma pigmentosum, excision repair after UV damage is normal, but there is a slow recovery of DNA and RNA synthesis. Any excision repair defects seem to be restricted to actively transcribed genes (Venema et al., 1990). Lehmann et al., (1993) reviewed their findings in investigating RNA synthesis in 52 possible cases of Cockayne syndrome. Twenty-nine showed an abnormality. Of the 23 normal cases, 4 were felt to have features that were clinically completely consistent with Cockayne syndrome according to the criteria of Nance and Berry (1992). Of the cases with an abnormal RNA response, photosensitivity was present in almost all cases and pigmentary retinopathy and dental caries were felt to be good discriminatory clinical features. Cleaver et al., (1994) reported the experience of prenatal diagnosis in either amniotic fluid or CVS cells using assays of DNA repair after UV light irradiation.
UNUSUAL CASES
    Greenshaw et al., (1992) reported a Hispanic family where three sibs had features of De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome (qv) but the response of the cells to UV light was more characteristic of Cockayne syndrome. Czeizel et al., (1995) reports a case with normal intelligence, overlapping features of acrogeria but with skin photosensitivity.
    Fryns et al., (1991) reported a possible case, with late onset at around 8-9 years, who had a del(10)(q11.23q21.2). 
    Reiss et al., (1996) reported a boy who died at the age of 6 years with some features of Cockayne syndrome. He had evidence of nephrotic syndrome, secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, adrenocortical failure and hypertension.
CLINICAL VARIANTS
    The severe early-onset form of the disease is probably the same as cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome. Some cases have a milder phenotype without abnormalities of DNA repair. There may also be a later-onset form with normal intelligence and relatively normal growth (Felgenhauer and Ammann, 1976; Fujiwara et al., 1981; Kennedy et al., 1980; Lanning and Simila 1970). Miyauchi et al., (1994) reported two adult sibs (aged 42 and 55) with features of the condition. Their IQs were in the mild to moderately delayed range. Both showed extreme UV sensitivity but had almost normal UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis.
    Itoh et al., (1994, 1995, 1996) reported three cases with increased sensitivity to sunlight including cutaneous photosensitivity, freckling, dryness, and telangiectasia, but without neurological abnormalities. These features were similar to xeroderma pigmentosum however UV irradiation studies were more indicative of Cockayne syndrome. Cells from these patients do not appear to belong to any of the xeroderma pigmentosum or Cockayne syndrome complementation groups however. The authors suggested the name \UV-sensitive syndrome\ (UVs syndrome).
GENETICS  
    In complement group B patients, Troelstra et al., (1992) reported mutations in the ERCC6 gene which is involved in the preferential repair of the transcribed strand of DNA. This gene has homology to RNA and DNA helicases. Further mutations in the ERCC6 gene were reported by Mallery et al., (1998). Henning et al., (1995) found mutations in a gene which they called CSA (also called CKN1) in complement group A patients.  It appears that CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with the p44 protein subunit of RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor (TFIIH). Selby and Sancar (1997) showed that the CSB protein enhances elongation by RNA polymerase II. Colella et al., (1999) reported mutations in the CSB gene in three patients without photosensitivity.
    Vermeulen et al., (1993) reported further studies on the children first described by Jaeken et al., (1989). They were found to have a biochemical defect typical of xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group G, indicating that some mutations in the seven genes known to be involved in xeroderma pigmentosum can sometimes give rise to the picture of Cockayne syndrome. Hamel et al., (1996) and Moriwaki et al., (1996) reported further cases with overlapping features with xeroderma pigmentosum belonging to complementation group G. There were features of COFS syndrome. O'Donovan and Wood (1993) showed that the XP-G complementing protein (XPGC) is likely to be the same as the mouse ERCC5 gene. Scherly et al., (1993) showed homology of this gene to the yeast RAD2 gene. In the human the XPGC gene maps to 13q32-33. Nouspikel et al., (1997) demonstrated mutations in the gene in 3 patients with XPG/CF features. Other patients reported with overlapping clinical features of xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (Weeda et al., 1990; Vermeulen et al., 1994) have been found to have mutations in the DNA repair and transcription gene ERCC3. These cases belong to XP complementation group B. Weeda et al., (1991) mapped this gene to 2q21. Other cases with features of xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome have been assigned to XP group D (Wood, 1991). Broughton et al., (1995) reported a case with mutations in the XP-D gene, the product of which is one of the subunits of the transcription factor TFIIH. XP-D mutations are also seen in patients with trichothiodystrophy (qv). Coin et al., (1998) showed that the XPD gene product, which codes for a helicase does not interact with p44, a subunit of TFIIH, if pathological mutations are present. Itoh (1996) showed that two cases with features of  DeSanctis-Cacchione syndrome belonged to complementation group B of Cockayne syndrome. Taylor et al., (1994) and Chu and Mayne (1996) provides good reviews of this complicated situation. Woods (1998) and Auerbach and Verlander (1997) provide good reviews of DNA repair defects.

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Probably the most common form of lethal bone dysplasia, with an incidence of about 1 in 20,000, this condition may be caused by a new autosomal dominant mutation. The limbs are extremely short with rolls of redundant skin, and the fingers are short with a trident configuration. The chest is very narrow and most infants die within a few hours of birth from respiratory failure. The head is large with a prominent forehead and a depressed nasal bridge. Radiographs reveal shortening of the long bones with metaphyseal flaring and cupping, and characteristically curved femurs ('telephone receiver'). The iliac wings are hypoplastic and the sacrosciatic notches narrow. Severe flattening of the vertebral bodies is seen which gives a 'H' or inverted 'U' shape when the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are viewed on an AP radiograph.
    Corsello et al., (1992) reported male monozygotic twins with thanatophoric dysplasia type I concordant for long bone abnormalities and discordant for cloverleaf skull.
    Hersh et al., (1995) reported a convincing case with a balanced chromosome translocation - t(1q42;10q11.2). Rivas et al., (1987) reported a case born to a mother with a inv(4)(p16q21). The baby's chromosomes were not examined. These translocation reports may be spurious as most cases appear to be caused by sporadic mutations in the FGFR3 gene on 4p (see below). 
    Tavormina et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Of 39 cases, 22 had an Arg248Cys substitution in the link between the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains and one case had a Ser371Cys substitution between the third immunoglobulin-like and transmembrane domains. The cases with the Arg248Cys substitution could either have cloverleaf, or normal skulls, representing variable expressivity. Rousseau et al., (1995) reported three separate mutations in the stop codon of FGFR3 in five out of fifteen type I thanatophoric dysplasia patients without cloverleaf skull. The mutations were expected to give rise to a protein elongated by 141 amino acids. Rousseau et al., (1996) and Nerlich et al., (1996) further define the mutational spectrum and phenotypic/genotypic correlation in thanatophoric dysplasia type 1. Wilcox et al., (1998) studied 91 cases. FGFR3 mutations were identified in every case. Cases with a Lys650Glu mutation had straight femora and  craniosynostosis. In all other cases the femora were curved and craniosynostosis was infrequent. Cases with the Tyr373Cys substitution tended to have more severe radiographic manifestations than the Arg248Cys cases, but with overlap. The data suggested that Thanatophoric dysplasia could be subdivided into two groups (type I and type II), based on the presence or absence of curved femora. Craniosynostosis can occur in both types,  but is more common in type II.
    Baker et al., (1997) reported an extraordinary case with thanatophoric dysplasia type 1.  An Arg248Cys mutation was demonstrated. The patient was alive at 9 years of age. At 8 years of age development was thought to be at the 18 months level. The patient developed acanthosis nigricans. 
    Naski et al., (1996) showed that mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause a gradient of ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation in thanatophoric dysplasia, achondrogenesis and hypocondroplasia.  It should be noted that FGFR3 haploinsufficiency in the mouse results in elongation of the long bones. Nguyen et al., (1997) studied calcium signaling in fibroblasts from cases with homozygous achondroplasia, heterozygous achondroplasia, TD1 and TD2, and concluded that mutant FGFR3 can function in a dosage dependent dominant-negative fashion to inactivate FGFR signaling. Brodie et al., (1998) reported a case of thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 due to a Try373Cys in the FGFR3 gene where there was 2-3 syndactyly of the toes and 4-5 syndactyly of the fingers. In a knock-in experiment Li et al., (1999) introduced a FGFR3 gene incorporating a Lys644Glu substitution into mice. This mutation corresponds to the Lys650Glu mutation in humans which gives a TDII phenotype. Transgenic mice had dramatically reduced proliferation of growth plate cartilage, macrocephaly, and shortening of the long bones. The mutant receptor caused activation of Stat1, Stat5a, and Stat5b and the up-regulation of P16, P18, and P19 cycle inhibitors.</abstract>

    >    The subject of this report was a hydropic fetus with very short limbs and a large swollen tongue. The nasal bridge was depressed and the mandible was small. Radiologically the thorax seemed long and narrow and the short tubular bones had metaphyseal flaring and cupping. The small bones of the hands and feet were wide and short and particularly marked was the advanced ossification of the carpal and tarsal bones. There was also laryngeal cartilage calcification. The other unusual feature was the presence of mineralized teeth in the fetus.
    Spranger and Maroteaux (1990), Young et al., (1993), Leroy et al., (1996) and Loshkajian et al., (1997) reported further cases. den Hollander et al., (1997) reported a case diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound at 18 weeks.</abstract>

    >There is some debate as to whether this condition is separate from the Saldino-Noonan form (Sillence, 1980). In addition to very short ribs and limbs there is post-axial polydactyly, abnormalities of cloacal development leading to anal and vaginal atresia or ambiguous genitalia, congenital heart defects and a generalised skeletal dysplasia. The ribs are extremely short and horizontal, the vertebrae small and abnormally formed, the ilia small, and the metaphyses of the long bones widened without the marked lateral spikes seen in Saldino-Noonan syndrome. Yang et al., (1980) reported PAS-positive and diastase-resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the chondrocytes. 
    De Sierra et al., (1992) reported a case with complete situs inversus and hypospadias. Bronstein et al., (1994) reported a possible case with multiple cysts of the pancreas and dysplastic kidneys with spongy microcyst formation. This case also had features of Jeune syndrome, as did the case reported by Majewski et al., (1996).
    Wu et al., (1995) reported a non-consanguineous couple who had four babies with features of short rib-polydactyly syndrome (including one set of monozygotic twins). Two of these sibs had features of the Verma-Naumoff type and two cases had similarities to the cases reported by Le Marec et al., (1973). One case had cerebellar absence, one absence of the spleen, and one situs inversus. Hentze et al., (1998) reported a case and discuss the overlap with the Saldino-Noonan type.</abstract>

    >This craniotubular bone dysplasia is characterised by sclerosis of the skull, which includes the vault and the base, combined with abnormal metaphyseal modelling of the long bones. The initial symptoms are often progressive nasal obstruction and mouth breathing in childhood. In familial cases the facial distortion might be the earliest complaint. Clinically there is broadening  of the nasal base with paranasal bossing, telecanthus and a prominence of the facial bones, especially the jaw.  Bilateral facial weakness and progressive deafness might be other childhood signs. Intelligence is usually normal. Richards et al., (1996) reported surgical management of the craniofacial abnormalities. Most families have shown autosomal dominant inheritance although autosomal recessive inheritance has been occasionally observed, (Penchaszadeh et al., 1980; Tinschert and Braun 1998). The main differential diagnosis is craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. Elcioglu and Hall (1998) provide a follow up of an autosomal recessive case.
    Nurnberg et al., (1997) mapped the gene to 5p14.1-p15.2 in a dominant family.</abstract>

    >    This is the severe, usually lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Sillence et al., (1984) have subdivided this condition into three separate subgroups according to radiological features. All the infants have short, deformed limbs with clinical evidence of bowing and abnormal angulation of the long bones. The chest is narrow. The nose might be beaked and there may be blue sclerae.
    In group A there is a marked reduction of ossification of the cranial vault and facial bones. There is continuous beading of the ribs, indicating multiple fractures. The femora are broad and crumpled with fine wavy margins. The other long bones may have a similar appearance, or have multiple fractures. The vertebrae are flattened and hypoplastic, and the pelvis is hypoplastic with flattening of the acetabular roofs and iliac crests.
    In group B the skull and long bones are similar to type A but the ribs show only occasional beading. 
    In group C there is extreme underossification of the skull and face. The ribs are slender and show occasional beading. The femora are markedly osteopenic with narrowing of the shafts and multiple angulations. Similar abnormalities are seen in the other long bones.
    It is likely that most cases of OI type IIA are caused by new dominant mutations of one of the type I collagen genes, although recurrences have been reported which are thought to be caused by gonadal mosaicism in one parent (Byers and Steiner, 1992). Cole and Dalgleish (1995) provide a good review of lethal OI including genotype-phenotype correlations. The overall recurrence risk for all type II cases is about 5-7% (Thompson  et al., 1987; Cole and Dalgleish, 1995). However the recurrence risk for a type IIA case is probably lower than 5% and for types IIB and IIC possibly around 7%, as several affected sibs have been reported, as well as a higher incidence of parental consanguinity (Thompson et al., 1987; Sillence et al., 1984).
    Pepin et al., (1997) described the approach to and experience with prenatal diagnosis by molecular and biochemical methods in a 129 cases with different types of Osteogenesis imperfecta.</abstract>

    >This condition has many similarities to Kniest syndrome and pathologically they are very similar. Both have a flat face and a cleft palate and the infants are considerably short, often with respiratory distress due to a narrow chest. Both have short tubular bones with metaphyseal flaring, and the vertebral bodies are abnormal in shape with coronal clefts. However, in the condition under discussion the clefts affect almost all the vertebral bodies, which is not usually the case in Kniest. They are irregular with anterior wedging and kyphoscoliois is a complication. Unlike Kniest syndrome, the tibia and fibula might be bowed and the ribs are short with flaring at their anterior ends. The 1st metatarsal and the proximal phalanx of the great toe are large and there is a large, poorly modelled talus and calcaneus. Prabhu et al., (1998) reported a male infant, the offspring of first cousin Druze Lebanese parents, who survived to 8 months of age. This child had subluxation of the lens with \Salt and Pepper\ changes of the retinal epithelial pigment layers. There was also an arachnoid cyst and a venous angioma in the region of the left basal ganglia. Stoll et al., (1998) reported a case detected prenatal at 34 weeks by ultrasound examination.

    >    This is the severe, usually lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Sillence et al., (1984) have subdivided this condition into three separate subgroups according to radiological features. All the infants have short, deformed limbs with clinical evidence of bowing and abnormal angulation of the long bones. The chest is narrow. The nose might be beaked and there may be blue sclerae.
    In group A there is a marked reduction of ossification of the cranial vault and facial bones. There is continuous beading of the ribs, indicating multiple fractures. The femora are broad and crumpled with fine wavy margins. The other long bones may have a similar appearance, or have multiple fractures. The vertebrae are flattened and hypoplastic, and the pelvis is hypoplastic with flattening of the acetabular roofs and iliac crests.
    In group B the skull and long bones are similar to type A but the ribs show only occasional beading. 
    In group C there is extreme underossification of the skull and face. The ribs are slender and show occasional beading. The femora are markedly osteopenic with narrowing of the shafts and multiple angulations. Similar abnormalities are seen in the other long bones.
    It is likely that most cases of OI type IIA are caused by new dominant mutations of one of the type I collagen genes, although recurrences have been reported which are thought to be caused by gonadal mosaicism in one parent (Byers and Steiner, 1992). Cole and Dalgleish (1995) provide a good review of lethal OI including genotype-phenotype correlations. The overall recurrence risk for all type II cases is about 5-7% (Thompson  et al., 1987; Cole and Dalgleish, 1995). However the recurrence risk for a type IIA case is probably lower than 5% and for types IIB and IIC possibly around 7%, as several affected sibs have been reported, as well as a higher incidence of parental consanguinity (Thompson et al., 1987; Sillence et al., 1984).
    Pepin et al., (1997) described the approach to and experience with prenatal diagnosis by molecular and biochemical methods in a 129 cases with different types of Osteogenesis imperfecta.</abstract>

    >This rare condition is more common in the Lebanon than elsewhere. The main features are mental retardation, short stature, progressive sternal bulging and delayed bone age. The skeletal changes are present by the age of 4 years when flattening of the vertebral bodies, with radiolucent depression in their mid-portion, can be detected. Within a few years the vertebral bodies become flat and there is a lacy appearance of the iliac crest on X-raying the pelvis. The femoral heads are delayed in their ossification and they might be fragmented. Progressive hip dislocation might occur. The head circumference is often below the 3rd centile and, although many cases are severely retarded, the degree of retardation is variable. 
    The condition is probably heterogeneous. Yunis et al., (1980) suggest that there are two forms with autosomal and X-linked recessive inheritance. Some autosomal recessive cases have more severe skeletal abnormalities and are associated with mental retardation, however there are also apparent autosomal recessive cases with normal intelligence. Yunis et al., (1980) reported a large X-linked pedigree where mental retardation was not a feature and suggested that the cases reported by Smith and McCort (1958), Gwinn and Barnes (1968), and Linker et al., (1970) could be examples of further X-linked cases where mental retardation may not be a feature. Nakamura et al., (1997) reported two further cases of the Smith-McCort phenotype. They also showed from iliac crest biopsies that the rough endoplasmic reticulum contains fine granular or amorphous material. This is also seen in cases with mental retardation.
    Roesel et al., (1991) reported an 40-month-old boy with the condition who had increased pipecolic acid in plasma and urine.
    Spranger (1993) suggests that the cases reported by Diren et al., (1992) as a form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia in fact have this condition.</abstract>

    >Langer et al., (1991) reported a brother and sister, the offspring of Polish first cousins, with a form of craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia with wormian bones in the skull. The long bones were wide, without normal metaphyseal flaring and without diaphyseal constriction. There was cortical thinning. The ribs and scapulae were broad. Apart from wormian bones, radiographs of the skull showed some thickening of the base and vault with minor sclerosis. There was a dense bony projection extending inferiorly from the occipital bone. The same sibs were reported by Williams et al., (1988). Santolaya et al., (1998) reported a 4 year old Moroccan boy, the offspring of first cousins, with features of the condition. The bones of the hand were striking with absence of normal diaphyseal constriction, increased bone transparency, thin cortices, and sclerotic metaphyseal bands.
    Gorlin (1994) considers this condition to be identical to the case reported by Schwarz (1960) but not the case reported by Lelek (1962). These cases had previously been included under the designation Schwarz-Lelek syndrome. Gorlin considers a case reported by Lelek to be an example of craniometaphyseal dysplasia.</abstract>

    >    Type IV OI is similar to type I, but the sclerae might be normal and mild short stature with limb bowing is a feature. Most cases are autosomal dominant. Charnas and Marini (1993) reported their experience with neuroimaging in 31 cases. Two had basilar invagination, three macrocephaly and two ventricular enlargement. This type might be difficult to distinguish from type III in the neonatal period, and recurrence risks after an isolated case are about 7% (Thompson et al., 1987).
    Sykes et al., (1990) showed linkage to the COL1A2 locus in eight pedigrees. Lund et al., (1997) suggested that type I mutations were common, and that parental mosaicism was an explanation for some recurrences. Schwarze et al., (1999) reported a heterozygous splice-site mutation in the COL1A1 gene in a nine year old girl with features of OI type IV.

    >This condition was first described by Winchester et al., (1969) in two sisters with first cousin parents. Hollister et al., (1974) described three more patients from an inbred Mexican kindred. Onset of the condition may be towards the end of the first year of life with symmetrical painful swelling of the hands, fingers, wrists and ankles. Intermittent polyarthralgia results in progressive joint contractures. Oval or linear raised areas of thickened skin may appear over the back, flanks and lateral aspects of the arm. These lesions spread to cause leathery, thickened, hypertrichotic, pigmented skin. Other features are corneal opacities appearing in mid-childhood, retarded growth, carpal and tarsal osteolysis and rheumatoid-like destruction of the small joints. Histology reveals replacement of bone with dense fibrous tissue and abnormal fibroblasts. One of the cases reported by Dunger et al., (1987) in fact had infantile system hyalinosis and in the other case, although Winchester syndrome was confirmed, the reported oligosacchariduria could not be substantiated (Winter, 1989).

    >Children with this condition usually present with a painless swelling in a limb. The usual sites are the distal end of the femur or tibia, or the ankle. The limb on that side is often thinner than on the unaffected side, but the muscle wasting might be secondary. The underlying defect is an asymmetrical overgrowth of one or more of the epiphyses. The involvement of only the medial or lateral side in either the right or left limb has led to the designation of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelia.</abstract>

    >The onset of Hurler syndrome is in the 1st year of life and the mean age of diagnosis is around 9 months (Cleary and Wraith, 1995). The earliest abnormalities are around 3 months with rhinitis, recurrent infections, and sometimes recurrent inguinal herniae. Skeletal abnormalities become apparent at around the age of 6 months and a gibbus or other spinal malformations may be noted. Chest asymmetry, a prominent sternum, and a prominent forehead may also be detected. The facies become obviously coarse from around 9 months of age and a conductive hearing loss may develop. Although hepatosplenomegaly is part of the syndrome, this is not the presenting feature in the majority of cases. Skin may be thickened and there may be skin coloured papules (Schiro et al., 1996). Skeletal survey will show increasing signs of dysostosis multiplex with pointing of the proximal metacarpals and a deficiency of ossification of the anterosuperior portion of the vertebral bodies. It should be remembered that a cardiomyopathy may be the presenting feature.
    Roubicek et al., (1985) described patients with a phenotype intermediate between Hurler and Scheie, in that the facial features are coarse or sometimes impish, but unlike Hurler, and mental retardation and skeletal changes are mild. Death occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade. They also note those cases with typical features except for the mildness of the mental defect. The authors cite other sibships concordant for the mild type and note also five instances of parental consanguinity in the atypical cases, suggesting a separate allele and not compound heterozygosity. Scott et al., (1990) showed that the gene localisation was 4p16.3, rather than 22q11 as had been previously reported.
    The defective enzyme is alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) and the iduronidase gene has been fully characterised (Scott et al., 1991; Scott et al., 1992). There appear to be two common nonsense mutations, W402X and Q70X, which are responsible for between 15 and 65% of mutant alleles depending on the population. Bunge et al., (1994) reported other mutant alleles present in individual cases. Lee-Chen and Wang (1997) reported mutations in Chinese families.
    Hopwood et al., (1993) reported their experience in treating three patients with bone marrow transplantation. Although the phenotype was modified there was still physical handicap and developmental delay (in two). The authors concluded that bone marrow transplantation should be performed within the first few months of life in order to offer the best prognosis. Peters et al., (1996) studied 40 patients given bone marrow transplants with age range .9 to 3.2 years at transplant. 50% of patients were alive at 2 years, 25% of patients received at second bone marow transplant because of graft rejection or failure. From evidence of psychological testing, the authors concluded that MPS I H patients with a mental development index greater than 70 achieved a favourable long term developmental outcome. Vellodi et al., (1997) reported their experience of 38 patients that had bone marrow transplants. 13 patients survived 5 years or more. Although psychomotor regression slowed or was arrested, dysostosis multiplex progressed. Gatzoulis et al., (1995) reported their experience with patients treated by bone marrow transplantation with regard to cardiac function. In 2 cases left ventricular restriction resolved. Further aspects of bone marrow transplantation are discussed by Peters et al., (1998) and a follow up of nine patients is provided by Guffon et al., (1998). In the latter study all patients had learning difficulties but none had severe mental retardation. Eight patients required surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Dysostosis multiplex could be progressive and required orhthopediatic correction in some cases.</abstract>

    >    Manzke (1966) published a detailed report of an infant first briefly reported by Catel in 1961. Since that time about ten further cases have been described. The key features are micrognathia, cleft palate, glossoptosis and an accessory (usually triangular) bone at the base of the index finger. Clinically the children have the appearance of severe Pierre Robin association with a short, flexed and ulnar-deviated index finger. Five cases have had congenital heart disease, mainly septal defects. Thompson et al., (1986) described a case with dislocatable knees. Most cases have been sporadic with male preponderance but Gewitz et al., (1978) described an affected male whose brother died of Pierre Robin association and an ASD, and Stevenson et al., (1980) described male-to-male transmission of the finger deformity in a family with a fully affected child.
    Wilson et al., (1993) reported another possible case. This 2 1/2-year-old boy had some unusual features. He had developmental delay, a right iris coloboma, a VSD, and scoliosis. Two maternal uncles were said to have been similarly affected.
    Petit et al., (1994) reported another unusual case. This was a 19-week fetus picked up by ultrasound because of nuchal oedema. One thumb was absent and there was some radial hypoplasia. There was mitral valve atresia, a hypoplastic left ventricle, and a VSD with pulmonary valve atresia and hypoplasia of the pulmonary trunk (a form of Fallot's tetralogy). There was absence of lobulation of the right lung.
    Dudin et al., (1995) reported an 8-year-old boy with a choledochal cyst who had hand features of the condition only.</abstract>

    >Type III OI presents with fractures at birth and is characterised by progressive deformity of the bones. In the neonate the femora are shortened and the metaphyses may be flared. The diaphyses are thin and often show mid-shaft angulation. The ribs are slender and sometimes have fractures. The skull is well mineralised but has multiple wormian bones. At 2-5 years of age bone cysts become apparent, as does the appearance of multiple microfractures in the epiphyses (\popcorn epiphyses\). Short stature and limb bowing are progressive. Dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are common. Charnas and Marini (1993) described their experience with neuroimaging of 33 cases. Six had basilar invagination, six macrocephaly and twelve ventricular enlargement. Landsmeer-BeKer et al., (1997) treated three cases with bisphosphonate olpadronate. This is thought to result in a decreased number of fractures and increased calcification of the long bones with an amelioration of the vertebral shape.
    Many cases are due to dominant mutations of one of the type I collagen chains (Byers et al., 1991; Forlino et al., 1994; Rose et al., 1995, Nuytinck et al., 1996; Lund et al., 1997 and Cole et al., 1996) although there are rare recessive families. Namikawa et al., (1995) reported two affected sibs where the father was shown to be mosaic for a COL1A1 mutation. Lund et al., (1996) (in 2 papers) reported a family where a proband had a type III/IV phenotype and was thought to be heterozygous for a COL1A2 mutation. A third affected sib was detected prenatally and the father was found to be mosaic. Lund et al., (1997) presaent further evidence suggesting that parental mosaicism is common in OI type III and IV.
     A recessive gene for this condition may be common in South African blacks, and the gene in this community has been shown not to be linked to either of the type I collagen chains (Wallis et al., 1993). Cole and Lamb (1996) reported a case with a COL1A2 mutation who had an arachnoid cyst. De Paepe et al., (1997) reported sibs, the offspring of consanguineous parents, who were homozygous for a COL1A2 mutation causing a glucine to serine substitution at position 751. Recurrence risks after an isolated case are about 7% (Thompson et al.,1987).
    Pepin et al., (1997) described the approach to and experience with prenatal diagnosis by molecular and biochemical methods in a 129 cases with different types of Osteogenesis imperfecta.</abstract>

    >    Birth-weight may be low, less than 2500 gm, but major problems with growth do not occur until after the first year, when growth may almost cease. An important early sign may be scleroedema of the skin of the lower trunk and upper legs. This can give an oedematous appearance, but the skin is hard to the touch. Later the skin becomes thinned and atrophic. Erdem et al., (1994) report such a case and review other cases in the literature. After the first year progressive signs of apparent ageing appear; loss of scalp hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, prominent scalp veins and a small triangular face with a relatively large cranial vault. The mandible is small with crowded teeth that erupt late. The nose is thin and beaked. The skin becomes dry and thin and the nails are brittle and short (reflecting shortening of the underlying distal phalanges). There is generalised wasting with a cachectic appearance and prominent joints. Hypertension, cardiomegaly and early atheroma can occur. Death is in the second decade in most cases. The diagnosis in the case reported by Gillar et al., (1991) is uncertain - it could be mandibulo-acral dysplasia. This case had irregular pigmentary changes of the abdominal skin which first appeared as \burn-like strial markings\. Later the lesions were described as hypopigmented. Likewise the diagnosis in the case reported by Labeille et al., (1987) with scleroderma-like skin changes is uncertain. Hou and Wang (1995) also reported a baby with early onset features of progeria associated with sclerodermatous skin changes. Note that some bona fide cases of early childhood progressive systemic sclerosis can develop a very progeroid appearance (Urano et al., 1981). Ishikawa et al., (1993) also reported a 17 year old girl with severe progeroid features who had a scleroderma-like variant of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
    Matsuo et al., (1994) reported a 7-year-old boy who was thought to have the condition (although no photographs were published). He had normal mental development, but an MRI scan revealed a previous brain infarction in the right putamen. Fibroblast culture was said to demonstrate 76% unscheduled DNA synthesis. Wang et al., (1991) also reported this phenomenon in four patients. Oshima et al., (1996) reported no detectable mutations in the Werner helicase gene.
    Most cases are sporadic, although there have been a few reports of affected sibs. Fatunde et al., (1990) described three affected sibs. Maciel (1988) reported an inbred pedigree with affected individuals in two sibships. Khalifa (1989) reported a similar inbred family with three affected individuals. Radiographs revealed absent clavicles, coxa valga and widened metaphyses. The long bones were generally thin and there was absence of terminal phalanges.</abstract>

    >First described by Seckel in 1960, this syndrome has probably been overdiagnosed (Majewski and Goecke, 1982; Thompson and Pembrey, 1985). Majewski and Goecke (1982) carefully analysed the diagnostic criteria. These include intrauterine growth retardation (average birth-weight 1543 g at term), severe microcephaly (average -8.7 SD), short stature (average -7.1 SD), retarded bone age and moderate to severe mental retardation (50% of cases have an IQ below 50). The face is characteristic with a receding forehead, large beaked nose, receding chin and antimongoloid eyeslant. Dislocation of the radial head is common, as are 5th finger clinodactyly, absent ear lobes, and teeth abnormalities. Thompson and Pembrey (1985) pointed out that facial asymmetry, protruding eyes, and an abnormal stance (fixed flexion at the hips and knees) are all part of the syndrome. Many cases in the literature do not meet the full criteria (eg. the case reported by Aslan et al., (1995) with cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung). Case 1 in the paper of Buebel et al., (1996) most likely has the condition described in this database under Hurst (1988a) (qv). The case detected by ultrasound prenatally by Featherstone et al., (1996) had lissencephaly and absence of the corpus callosum on CT scan of the brain. Shanske et al., (1997) also reported a family where 3 children had agenesis of the corpus callosum, a dysgenetic cerebral cortex, a large dorsal cerebral cyst and pachygyria. D'Angelo et al., (1998) reported a convincing case with multiple intracranial aneurysms.
    Anderson et al., (1997) reported a 26 year old man with some features of Seckel syndrome and a ring chromosome 4 mosaicism. However birth weight was not very low and microcephaly was not extremely severe.</abstract>

    >Stern et al., (1990) reported two male and three female infants with a condition showing features of both atelosteogenesis type I (AOI) and otopalatodigital syndrome type II (OPDII). There was rhizomelic shortening and bowing of the limbs, absent or hypoplastic fibulae, multiple joint dislocations and abnormalities of the hand bones. The facies were characterised by a broad forehead, hypertelorism, a flat nasal bridge and a cleft palate. Radiographs of the spine revealed platyspondyly, scoliosis, coronal clefts, sagittal clefts and segmentation defects. The humeri were short with distal tapering as in AOI. In the hands the proximal phalanges were relatively large and evenly ossified with convex ends, and sometimes with a distal notch. The middle phalanges were round and hypoplastic and the distal phalanges short and broad. Respiratory difficulties, feeding problems and hydrocephalus led to a 50% mortality in the neonatal period. All cases were isolated. 
    Schultz et al., (1999) reported a 23 year old female with features of the condition. She gave birth to an affected son. </abstract>

    >    This syndrome was first described by Donohue (1948) and Donohue and Uchida, (1954). There is intrauterine growth retardation, hirsutism, an aged face with thickened lips and prominent ears, failure to thrive and enlargement of the breasts and genitalia. The hands and feet are relatively large and acanthosis nigricans and lipodystrophy may be features. Hyperplasia of the pancreatic islet cells is seen at autopsy as well as cystic changes of the gonads. Elsas et al., (1985) demonstrated an inherited defect of high-affinity insulin receptors in an 8-year-old black female. Several other cases have been reported with insulin receptor mutations (see review by O'Rahilly and Moller, 1992). Prenatal diagnosis by DNA analysis was reported by Longo et al., (1995). The same authors suggest that insulin binding assays are not reliable in amniocytes. Prenatal diagnosis reported by molecular analysis of the insulin receptor gene by Desbois-Mouthon et al., (1997).
    Moller and Flier (1991) and Taylor (1992) provide excellent reviews of syndromes characterised by insulin resistance.
    Solomon and Shalwitz (1992) reported a case with markedly elevated hCG in cord blood. This was normal by the 11th day.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >    This condition appears primarily to be a form of myotonic myopathy with an associated chondrodysplasia. Blepharophimosis, difficulty in opening the mouth, an expressionless face, ptosis, muscle wasting with myotonia and joint limitation all suggest an underlying abnormality of muscle. Skeletal abnormalities include kyphoscoliosis, lumbar lordosis, pectus carinatum, bowing of the long bones, pes planus, a valgus deformity of the ankles and wide metaphyses. Radiographs show platyspondyly, coronal clefts of the vertebral bodies, and an epiphyseal dysplasia, especially around the hips. However, Figuera et al., (1993) reported a case without skeletal anomalies and postulated a milder form of the disorder. In addition Moodley and Moosa (1990) reported a case with skeletal and clinical features of the condition but without clinical or electrophysiological evidence of myotonia. Ocular abnormalities such as microphthalmia or cataract have been reported.
    Seay et al., (1978) reported a patient who suffered malignant hyperpyrexia after ketamine, nitrous oxide and curare anaesthesia. Spaans et al., (1991) reported improvement in muscle symptoms after treatment with procainamide. Topaloglu et al., (1993) reported improvement of myotonia in three cases treated with carbamazepine. Squires and Prangley (1996) also reported a neonatal case that responded favourably to carbamazepine. Some cases present in the neonatal period with feeding and respiratory difficulties. Al-Gazali et al., (1996) review 11 cases with this presentation. Nine died from respiratory complications before 2 years of age. The condition was apparently autosomal recessive in these families..
    The differential diagnosis includes Marden-Walker and Freeman-Sheldon syndromes. 
    Pascuzzi et al., (1990) reported an affected father and son, raising the possibility of an autosomal dominant form of the condition, however the large majority of cases are autosomal recessive.
    Nicole et al., (1995) localized the gene to 1p34-p36 in recessive families. Refined localisation was reported by Fontaine et al., (1996). However Brown et al., (1997) reported two inbred families where a recessive neonatal form of Schwartz-Jampel did not map to 1p34. The families were previously reported by Al-Gazali et al., (1996).
    Giedion et al., (1997) tentatively subdivided reported cases into 3 types. Type 1a is usually recognised in childhood with moderate bone dysplasia. Type 1b is recognisable at birth and the bone dysplasia can resemble Kniest dysplasia. Type 2 manifests at birth and the bone dysplasia resembles Pyle disease. There is increased mortality in this type. The same authors showed that the locus in two sibs with the type 2 phenotype did not appear to map to 1p34-36. Siguady et al., (1998) reported two fetuses with overlapping features between Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome and the neonatal form of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. Superti-Furga et al., (1998) and Cormier-Daire et al., (1998) also suggest that Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome and Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 are allelic conditions.</abstract>

There is rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, with talipes equinovarus and brachydactyly or other defects of the hands. Radiological features include a characteristically hypoplastic humerus that tapers distally, a hypoplastic femur, platyspondyly with coronal clefts and absent or hypoplastic carpals, tarsals, metacarpals, metatarsals, and proximal and middle phalanges. Hunter and Carpenter (1991) suggest that it is reasonable to consider atelosteogenesis I and boomerang dysplasia as part of a spectrum, probably reflecting a common etiology. Greally et al., (1993) make the same point. Bejjani et al., (1998) reported a case detected prenatally by ultrasound scan at 15 weeks gestation.

    >Reardon et al., (1994) reported a father and two daughters with an unusual form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. All individuals were short and the father in particular had a short spine with marked lumbar lordosis. He also had shortening of the fingers with finger clubbing, although this was not noted in the daughters. The main presenting feature was atlanto-axial instability causing severe neurological signs in the two daughters. Apart from atlanto-axial subluxation, MRI scans showed an os odontoideum. Skeletal survey showed platyspondyly with irregularity of the end plates of the vertebrae, particularly in the lumbar region, a retarded bone age (with small carpal bones in the father), small, asymmetrical and irregular capital femoral epiphyses and shortening of the distal phalanges.</abstract>

    >    Radial aplasia, with preservation of the thumbs, is combined with thrombocytopenia of early onset. Megakaryocytes are reduced and anaemia, eosinophilia and a leukaemoid granulocytosis may be seen. If the infant survives, the haematological features become less severe. Lower limb malformations, congenital heart defect, and abnormalities of the ribs and cervical spine may also be seen. 
    Delooz et al., (1992) reviewed the evidence for a form of TAR syndrome with more severe limb defects. They reported a 23-week male fetus with phocomelia of the upper limbs (the hands attached directly to the shoulders) and femorotibial synostosis. Although there was no evidence of thrombocytopenia in this fetus, review of the literature revealed similar cases with TAR syndrome (Anyane-Yeboa et al., 1985; Pfeiffer et al., 1973; Ray et al., 1980). Midro et al., (1993) reported a case with severe limb defects and bilateral cleft lip and palate. The differential diagnosis in these cases is with Roberts syndrome.
    Brochstein et al., (1992) reported a 2-year-old girl who was successfully treated with bone marrow transplantation.
    Labrune et al., (1993) reported three cases diagnosed prenatally at 25, 31, and 36 weeks of pregnancy respectively. All cases were shown to have thrombocytopenia in utero, however Bialer (1994) disputed the diagnosis in two cases. Donnenfeld et al., (1990) diagnosed a case at 32 weeks.
    MacDonald et al., (1994) reported a case with developmental delay where delay in myelination and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia was demonstrated on MRI scans. Only 7% of cases are reported to have developmental delay. Urban et al., (1998) reported a 13 year old girl with overlapping features of TAR and Roberts syndrome. Premature separation of centromeres and heterochromatin repulsion was demonstrated in the neonatal period but this finding had disappeared by 13 years of age. Thrombocytopenia was intermittent and there were episodes of marked eosinophilia in the first two years of life.</abstract>

The condition is milder than Hurler syndrome, with normal stature and survival into adult life (McKusick et al., (1978) mention that one patient is aged 58 years). Corneal clouding is severe and there may also be pigmentary changes of the retina and glaucoma. Joint stiffness is particularly severe in the hands with clawing and carpal tunnel syndrome. Cardiac involvement involving the aortic and mitral valves is common. Presumed compound heterozygotes for Hurler and Scheie alleles have been reported with features intermediate in severity between the two conditions.

    >Singleton and Merten (1973) described two unrelated females and Gay and Kuhn (1976) an unrelated male and female with dental dysplasia, osteoporosis, aortic calcification and abnormal bones of the hands. The deciduous teeth became carious at an early age with premature loss. There was hypodontia of the permanent teeth. Osteoporosis was generalised and there were thin cortices of the metacarpals and metatarsals, with expanded medullary cavities, and poorly defined trabeculae. Acro-osteoloysis was a feature. Calcification of the proximal aorta became apparent between the ages of 4 and 12 years - this involved the aortic valve to give aortic stenosis. Two patients had a psoriaform skin eruption. Three patients had short stature. Intelligence was normal.</abstract>

    >MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME</name>
    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >    This syndrome is usually diagnosable at birth, but sometimes the characteristic webs (pterygia) do not develop until later in infancy. At birth there may be multiple joint contractures with camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus and rocker-bottom feet. The neck is short and may be webbed. The external genitalia can be hypoplastic in both males and females. The face is relatively immobile with downturned corners to the mouth, epicanthic folds and mild ptosis. Webs develop at the neck, axillae, antecubital, groin and popliteal regions. Scoliosis and kyphosis may develop and the stance becomes crouched. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, but note also that there is an autosomal dominant multiple pterygium syndrome and severe lethal types, which are probably separate entities. Kousseff and Nichols (1985) described a case with malignant hyperthermia. Robinson et al., (1987) also reported a severely affected infant born at 33 weeks gestation who also developed hyperthermia at nine days during an operation for pyloric stenosis. This male infant also had dextrocardia. Ramer et al., (1991) reported three sibs including identical twins. One twin had features consistent with the lethal multiple pterygium syndrome.
    Willems et al., (1993) reported a 28-week male fetus with features of multiple pterygium syndrome. He also had severe hypoplasia of the left arm and leg, and left kidney. There was anal atresia and hypospadias.
    Angle et al., (1997) reported a 15-year-old female with features of multiple pterygium syndrome, but with XY gonadal dysgenesis and mental retardation.</abstract>

    >    Chitty et al., (1996) reported two brothers, the offspring of second cousins, with short stature, sensorineural deafness and developmental delay. The face was triangular with a pointed chin. One brother had umbilical and inguinal herniae and lacrimal duct obstruction. Radiographs revealed a delayed bone age, with small fragmented femoral epiphyses, resembling Perthes' Disease. Scoliosis developed. There are some similarities to Pfeiffer (1973b) (qv). However the authors felt that the condition was different. </abstract>

    >    This condition most likely shares a common aetiology with the tricho-rhino-phalangeal (TRP) syndrome. Both conditions have been described in association with small deletions of the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24). It is likely that Langer-Giedion patients have a larger deletion than TRP patients. Ludecke et al., (1995) showed that the putative TRP gene maps more than 1000 kb proximal to the gene for multiple exostoses and that both genes are affected in Langer-Giedion syndrome. There is mild short stature, mild microcephaly, a squared-off, bulbous nose with thickened, notched alae nasi, a long, simple philtrum, sparse hair and prominent ears. Radiographs reveal cone-shaped epiphyses and proximal metaphyseal hooking of the phalanges and exostoses of the long bones. There is mild to moderate mental retardation. At birth the skin may be very loose. Fryns (1997) reported a case with hydrometrocolpos.
    Ramos et al., (1992) reported a case with an interstitial 8q deletion who had prune belly syndrome and a persistent cloaca.

    >    Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting in the accumulation of glucosyl ceramide because of a deficiency of the enzyme acid-glucosidase. There are three distinct phenotypes. Type I, the chronic non-neuronopathic or adult type, is more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews, and results in hepatosplenomegaly and bone abnormalities with secondary anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Episodes of bone crises can occur with acute pain and localised redness, tenderness and swelling, accompanied by a generalised fever. The X-ray findings include the resorption of trabeculae, and a moth-eaten appearance and expansion of the metaphyses to give an Erlenmeyer flask configuration. Pathological fractures are not infrequent. The age of onset is extremely variable.  Zevin et al., (1993) provide a good review of the manifestation of type I disease in childhood. le Coutre et al., (1997) and Grabowski (1997) review the mutational spectrum of the disorder. 
    Although most patients with the adult type of Gaucher disease do not have neurological involvement, there have been cases reported where seizures, mental deterioration, ataxia, and an ocular movement disorder have occurred. Chabas et al., (1995) reported three sibs with a D409H mutation, which is frequent in the Spanish population. Two sibs had onset of problems at 15 or 16 years of age with hepatosplenomegaly, ophthalmoplegia, saccadic eye movements and hyporeflexia. Corneal opacities were also noted. Death was at 17 and 19 years. The other sib developed hepatosplenomegaly at 18 months and tonic-clonic seizures at 10 years. In all three cases calcification of the mitral and aortic valves and of the ascending aorta was noted. This led to severe aortic stenosis with moderate mitral stenosis. This might be a separate subtype and is included under type IIIc in this database.
    Treatment by enzyme therapy has been effective (Barton et al., 1991) although the costs exceed $350,000 per year for an adult (Barranger, 1993). Aminohydroxy propylidene biphosphonate (APD) has been reported to reduce the frequency and severity of bone crises. Occasionally Gaucher disease types I and II have been reported in the same family (Shahinfar and Wenger, 1994).</abstract>

QA: How does this relate to 'short laterally'? Deficient laterally usually refers to proximal tibia. Short laterally refers to clavicles.
Q: This is fine for user vocab, but we need to be consistent re ontology. Narrow? We can discuss.</note>

    >Microstomia seems to occur in most cases. In addition the mouth is puckered with an H-shaped defect on the chin, giving the appearance of a whistling face. The nose is small, the philtrum long and the eyes are deepset. The other cardinal feature is camptodactyly with ulnar deviation of the digits. The feet are similarly involved, but might only present clinically with a vertical talus. Joint contractures elsewhere and a scoliosis are additional features. Intelligence is usually normal. Some children have full cheeks and some supraorbital fullness. In general the muscles are thin and there is evidence of an underlying myopathy. There is probably an autosomal recessive form, which is difficult to distinguish, but which may be more severe. Zampino et al., (1996) reported a case with a severe form of the condition who had cerebellar and brainstem atrophy and absent auditory brainstem responses. The child died at 5 months of respiratory failure Schrander-Stumpel et al., (1991) described three unrelated infants with features overlapping with Marden-Walker syndrome, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Illum (1988) (q.v.), but with no detailed neuropathology. They had distal arthrogryposis, severe developmental retardation, facial anomalies as seen in this syndrome (\whistling face\), and Pierre Robin sequence. It is also difficult to classify the infant reported by Sackey et al., (1995). This boy died at the age of 17 months with camptodactyly, talipes, inguinal hernia, joint contractures, cerebral atrophy, and seizures. Photographs show puffiness of the hands and feet and pale optic discs were noted so this infant may have had a variant of PEHO syndrome.
    Hennekam et al., (1992) reported a female infant with some features of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome but with developmental delay. The mother had total alopecia and a maternal autoimmune defect was postulated as a cause of the fetal abnormalities. Galliani and Matt (1993) reported a 10 1/2-week male with this condition who presented with laryngomalacia. Striated muscle cells within peripheral nerve trunks were found on histological examination of the arytenoid submucosa.
    Krakowiak et al., (1998) reported a large family with distal arthrogryposis, but with a distinctive facial appearance that they felt resembled Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. This was characterised by a triangular face, prominent nasolabial folds, downslanting palpebral fissures, a small mouth, and a prominent chin. Occasional cases can have normal limbs (Toydemir et al., 1999). 
    The gene for this condition was mapped to 11p15.5 (Krakowiak et al., 1997).</abstract>

    >    Cases have been reported with clinical features transitional between Mohr syndrome (OFD II) and Majewski syndrome (short rib-polydactyly II). Affected individuals have a midline cleft or notch of the upper lip, multiple oral frenula, fleshy nodules or hamartomas of the tongue, and a high or cleft palate. In the hands post-axial polydactyly is common and in the feet pre- and post-axial polydactyly can be seen. The tibia is severely hypoplastic, but does not have the ovoid shape seen in Majewski syndrome. Anal atresia has been reported (Meinecke and Hayek, 1990; Digilio et al., 1995). The ribs are relatively normal, allowing survival, but in some cases rib shortening can be demonstrated. Congenital heart defects have been reported including a single atrium, VSD, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, and tetralogy of Fallot (reviewed by Digilio et al., 1995). Some cases have cerebral abnormalities including Dandy-Walker malformation (Gillerot, 1988), or cerebral atrophy and micropolygyria (Burn et al., 1984; Digilio et al., 1995).
    Ades et al., (1994) reported a 27-week fetus with features of the condition, but with more severe internal abnormalities. There were midline clefts of the epiglottis and tongue with the larynx appearing to be a solid mass of cartilage with a lumen only shown histologically. The lungs were hypoplastic and there was a lobulated serous cyst anteroinferior to the liver. The small and large bowel was malrotated and there was a large lobulated intrahepatic cyst and enlarged cystic kidneys. Periportal hepatic fibrosis was demonstrated. The olfactory bulbs were absent and there appeared to be neuronal migration defects in the brain.
    Majewski et al., (1996) reported a case with overlapping features of Jeune and Mohr syndromes. 
    Toriello et al., (1997) reported six cases and provides a good review. </abstract>

    >    This syndrome is similar to OFD-1 (q.v.) but can usually be differentiated from it. Both males and females can be affected. The hair is normal. The tip of the nose may be bifid and milia are not pronounced in infancy. Otherwise the facial and oral features are similar to OFD-1. Another distinguishing feature is conductive hearing loss in OFD-2. In the limbs there may be post-axial polydactyly and skin syndactyly of the fingers, and bilateral duplication of the hallux is characteristic. Pseudarthrosis of the tibia can be a feature. Congenital heart defects, particullary atrioventricular canal defects have been reported (reviewed by Digilio et al., (1997))
    Mental retardation and tachypnoea have been reported, but there are clinical similarities to Joubert's syndrome and some cases may have been misdiagnosed in the past. Reardon et al., (1989) reported a possible case with a posterior fossa cyst and discussed the differential diagnosis. Haumont et al., (1983) and Gustavson et al., 1971) reported similar cases. Steichen-Gersdorf et al., (1994) reported a female infant with features of the condition and a hypoplastic epiglottis and larynx with stenosis of the trachea.</abstract>

    >Maroteaux et al., (1989) described five patients with a condition they called 'omodysplasia' after the Greek for humerus. Two of the cases were a mother and child previously described by Vallee et al., (1982) as cases of Robinow syndrome. The hallmark of the condition is rhizomelic limb shortening, particularly of the humeri, with hypoplastic humeral condyles, upper radioulnar diastasis and dislocation of the radial heads. The femurs have been described as club-like with a broad proximal metaphysis and distal tapering. There is variable shortening of the metacarpals. There is also a characteristic facies with a small nose with a rounded tip, a depressed nasal bridge and a long philtrum. The condition appears to be very variable, if all five cases have the same condition, and stature can be normal.
    Baxova et al., (1994) suggest that there are two forms of omodysplasia - an autosomal dominant form (cases 1, 2 and 3 of Maroteaux et al., 1989) and an autosomal recessive form (cases 4 and 5 of Maroteaux et al., 1989; Gugliantini et al., 1991; Kiss et al., 1991; Borochowitz et al., 1991). Borochowitz et al., (1998) report a 20 week old fetus detected prenatally with a recessive form of omodysplasia. Detailed histopathological studies of the bone and cartilage were provided.</abstract>

    >This autosomal dominant condition manifests with characteristic facies, microphthalmia, syndactyly of the 3rd, 4th and 5th digits, and other skeletal abnormalities. The nose is pinched with hypoplastic alae nasi and thin nares. Microphthalmia, microcornea, glaucoma and a persistent pupillary membrane have all been noted. Enamel hypoplasia of the teeth is common. Radiographs reveal hyperplasia of the body of the mandible and alveolar ridges, and broadening of the tubular bones. Brueton et al., (1990) and Schrander-Stumpel et al., (1993) have suggested that syndactyly type III has overlapping features. Several authors have noted spasticity and hyperreflexia (Barnard et al.,, 1981; Beighton et al., 1979; Reisner et al., 1969; Nivelon-Chevallier et al., 1981; Schrander-Stumpel and Franke, 1996). White matter changes and calcification of the basal ganglia can be seen. Schrander-Stumpel and Franke (1996) review the brain imaging studies in these patients. Gutmann et al., (1991) reported a 21-year-old female with progressive spastic paraparesis and abnormal white matter on NMR scan. They speculated that this might be the cause of spasticity in some patients. Ginsberg et al., (1996) reported similar MRI findings in a mother and daughter. Only the mother had evidence of spasticity. The daughter was aged 15 years. Norton et al., (1995) reported a two-generation pedigree where a father and five children were affected. The father had a progressive paraparesis and was found to have evidence of leukodystrophy on MRI scan. Gladwin et al., (1997) mapped the gene to 6q22-q24 in six families. These included the families reported by Brueton et al., (1990) and Schrander-Stumpel et al., (1993) where facial features were subtle and the diagnosis overlapped with syndactyly type III. Shapiro et al., (1997) presented evidence suggesting genetic anticipation. In a four generation family neurological signs of leukodystrophy seemed to appear earlier in successive generations. Borsani et al., (1999) mapped the EYA4 gene, which is a member of the vertebrate eyes absent family to 6q23. However no mutations were found in cases of ODD. </abstract>

    >    Sometimes called peripheral dysostosis, this syndrome was given the name acrodysostosis by Maroteaux and Malamut (1969). The facial appearance is characteristic in that the nose is hypoplastic; it is short with a broad tip, which is often dimpled, and with anteverted nostrils. Hypertelorism and epicanthic folds occur frequently. The short stature is prenatal in onset and birth weight and length are around the 3rd centile. Development is usually slow but seldom severely so. The hands are characteristic in that they are short and broad with a trident configuration, similar to achondroplasia. The skin outgrows the skeleton and is therefore redundant over the hands and feet. The nails are short and broad. Radiologically the metacarpals and phalanges are short with cone-shaped epiphyses, and there is hyperplasia of the first ray of the foot. Hamanishi et al., (1993) reported a 35-year-old woman with the condition where there was significant spinal canal stenosis. Viljoen et al., (1991) have pointed out that stippled epiphyses may be a feature. 
    Most cases are sporadic but occasional autosomal dominant families have been reported (Frey et al., 1982; Niikawa et al., 1978; Hernandez et al., 1991). Gorlin et al., (1990) consider this condition to be the same as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. See also Steiner and Pagon (1992) and Davies and Hughes (1992) for further discussion on this point. Wilson et al., (1997), however, found no evidence for reduced Gs-alpha bioactivity in two patients and in addition could find no mutations in the Gs-alpha gene.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Most authors now accept that Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (PHP) and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) are variants of the same condition. The original descriptions of PHP referred to patients with hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, obesity, a short stocky build, a round face, short bones in the fingers, especially the 4th and 5th metacarpals, and subcutaneous calcification. Patients with PPHP do not have demonstrable abnormalities of calcium metabolism, however precise clinical diagnosis is difficult because periods of normocalcaemia can occur in patients with PHP. All of these features are variable. Weight and height can be normal. Cataracts can occur in the hypocalcaemic form of the condition. Osteoporosis, osteomalacia, small epiphyses, acetabular dysplasia, exostoses and an advanced bone age are common manifestations, and less well known is the frequent shortening of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Mental retardation occurs in about 70% of hypocalcaemic and 30% of normocalcaemic cases (Fitch, 1982). Ectopic calcification frequently occurs in the kidneys, brain (basal ganglia) and other tissues. In the skin the histological appearance can be that of osteoma cutis (Izraeli et al.,1992) and lesions can appear and regress. This calcification is not confined to PHP and can also occur in PHPP. Hypothyroidism, stridor and carpal tunnel syndrome are additional complications and occasionally sudden visual loss occurs due to an enlarging sphenoid mucocele (Dowler et al., 1995).
    The sex ratio is F:M, 2:1 and although X-linked inheritance has been suggested in the past (Fitch, 1982), more recent genetic and molecular studies have confirmed autosomal dominant inheritance (see below).
    In type I the urinary cAMP response to administered parathyroid hormone (PTH) is blunted. In type II a cAMP response occurs but phosphate diuresis is blunted. Type Ia cases have the skeletal features of the condition whereas type Ib patients do not.
    The condition is caused by a defect in the alpha subunit of a G protein (Gs-alpha - coded by the GNAS1 gene) (the G proteins are a family of guanine-binding proteins that mediate signal transduction across cell membranes - Patten et al., 1990). PHP type Ia and PPHP can occur in the same family and both are associated with Gsa mutations and a 50% reduction in the Gs-alpha protein. PHP type Ib shows 100% Gs-alpha protein levels. A further subtype of PHP (type Ic) shows blunted cAMP and phosphate responses to PTH, skeletal features, but 100% Gs-alpha protein levels.
    Davies and Hughes (1993) presented evidence for genomic imprinting, with an excess of maternal transmission of the full syndrome and partial expression of the disease with paternal transmission. It is suggested that paternal transmission just results in the PPHP phenotype. However, Schuster et al., (1994) reported a family where PHP-Ia was inherited both maternally and paternally. Campbell et al., (1994) failed to find any evidence of monoparental expression of alleles of the GNAS1 gene in patients with PHP. There was also no tissue-specific expression pattern. Wilson et al., (1994) demonstrated a paternal mutation in two patients with PPHP. One of these cases was a female who gave birth to two children with PHP-Ia. The authors pointed out that if imprinting occurred at a tissue- or even cellular-specific level in renal tubular cells, which would express only the maternal Gsa allele, then the genetics of PHP and PPHP could be explained. However, Williamson et al., (1996) presented data suggesting that the Gnas1 mouse homolog was maternally imprinted in glomeruli in an opposite manner to that predicted in humans.
    Pollard et al., (1994) reported a family where the father had evidence of type Ib PPHP, but at least 3 children had type II PHP. The presentation in the proband was with apparent hysterical paralysis and a bipolar mood disorder at the age of 13 years.
    It seems likely that the sibs reported by Pierquin et al., (1992) had this condition, although one sib had coronal craniosynostosis and all had metopic ridging.
    Barr et al., (1994) reported a family where an infant had normal calcium and parathormone levels in infancy, together with a normal cyclic AMP response to injected parathormone, but raised parathormone and an abnormal cyclic AMP response at the age of 2 1/2 years.
    Iiri et al., (1994) demonstrated a mutation in the alpha subunit of the G protein G(s) causing constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and the testotoxicosis phenotype (secretion of testosterone by Leydig cells in the absence of luteinizing hormone). Paradoxically the two patients with this condition also had pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia because at 37 degrees centigrade the G protein rapidly degraded.
    Note that individuals with deletions of 2q37 can have short 4th and 5th metacarpals and resemble PPHP (Wilson et al., 1995; Phelan et al., 1995). Rauch et al., (1996) and Bijlsma et al., (1999) review the clinical features of other cases with 2q37 deletions. There is a round face with deep set eyes, a bulbous nasal tip, thin vermillion border of the lips, and sparse hair. Seizures appeared to be a feature of the condition. Power et al., (1997) reported a further case with 2q37 deletion and suggested that the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (RDCI) was a possible candiate gene.

    >This syndrome was first described by Majewski et al., (1982) who subdivided similar cases into types I, II and III. Winter et al., (1985) argued that types I and III may reflect the appearance of the same condition at different ages. This suggestion has been backed up by subsequent reports (Haan et al., 1989; Maroteaux et al., 1990; Meinecke et al., 1991). The latter authors reported affected sibs. The main features are low birth-weight dwarfism, extreme microcephaly, a prominent nose and eyes, sparse scalp hair, a short neck, short limbs with dislocation of the elbows and hips, relatively broad hands and feet and dry hyperkeratotic skin. Radiographs reveal shortening and bowing of the humeri and femora in type I and elongated clavicles, cleft cervical arches, lumbar platyspondyly, hypoplastic iliac wings and a horizontal acetabulum in type III. The sibs reported by Taybi and Linder (1967) may have had the same condition. The inheritance pattern is likely to be autosomal rcessive.
    Eason et al., (1995) reported a possible case with a generalized renal tubular leak leading to hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypophosphataemia. The baby died of a chest infection at 5 months. Berger et al., (1998) reported a case with neonatal cholestasis and focal medullary dysplasia of the kidneys. The case reported by Corsello et al., (1996) possibly falls into this group. She was five-years-old and had some evidence of craniosynostosis with shortened vertebral bodies. The CT scan findings of this case were reported by Costello and Giuffre (1998). they showed abscence of the frontal sulci and a trigonocephalic skull shape. Likewise the case reported by Boscherini et al., (1996) might represent type I or type III osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism.
    Sigaudy et al., (1998) reported four further cases and provide a good review.</abstract>

    >Most authors now accept that Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (PHP) and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) are variants of the same condition. The original descriptions of PHP referred to patients with hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, obesity, a short stocky build, a round face, short bones in the fingers, especially the 4th and 5th metacarpals, and subcutaneous calcification. Patients with PPHP do not have demonstrable abnormalities of calcium metabolism, however precise clinical diagnosis is difficult because periods of normocalcaemia can occur in patients with PHP. All of these features are variable. Weight and height can be normal. Cataracts can occur in the hypocalcaemic form of the condition. Osteoporosis, osteomalacia, small epiphyses, acetabular dysplasia, exostoses and an advanced bone age are common manifestations, and less well known is the frequent shortening of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Mental retardation occurs in about 70% of hypocalcaemic and 30% of normocalcaemic cases (Fitch, 1982). Ectopic calcification frequently occurs in the kidneys, brain (basal ganglia) and other tissues. In the skin the histological appearance can be that of osteoma cutis (Izraeli et al.,1992) and lesions can appear and regress. This calcification is not confined to PHP and can also occur in PHPP. Hypothyroidism, stridor and carpal tunnel syndrome are additional complications and occasionally sudden visual loss occurs due to an enlarging sphenoid mucocele (Dowler et al., 1995).
    The sex ratio is F:M, 2:1 and although X-linked inheritance has been suggested in the past (Fitch, 1982), more recent genetic and molecular studies have confirmed autosomal dominant inheritance (see below).
    In type I the urinary cAMP response to administered parathyroid hormone (PTH) is blunted. In type II a cAMP response occurs but phosphate diuresis is blunted. Type Ia cases have the skeletal features of the condition whereas type Ib patients do not.
    The condition is caused by a defect in the alpha subunit of a G protein (Gs-alpha - coded by the GNAS1 gene) (the G proteins are a family of guanine-binding proteins that mediate signal transduction across cell membranes - Patten et al., 1990). PHP type Ia and PPHP can occur in the same family and both are associated with Gsa mutations and a 50% reduction in the Gs-alpha protein. PHP type Ib shows 100% Gs-alpha protein levels. A further subtype of PHP (type Ic) shows blunted cAMP and phosphate responses to PTH, skeletal features, but 100% Gs-alpha protein levels.
    Davies and Hughes (1993) presented evidence for genomic imprinting, with an excess of maternal transmission of the full syndrome and partial expression of the disease with paternal transmission. It is suggested that paternal transmission just results in the PPHP phenotype. However, Schuster et al., (1994) reported a family where PHP-Ia was inherited both maternally and paternally. Campbell et al., (1994) failed to find any evidence of monoparental expression of alleles of the GNAS1 gene in patients with PHP. There was also no tissue-specific expression pattern. Wilson et al., (1994) demonstrated a paternal mutation in two patients with PPHP. One of these cases was a female who gave birth to two children with PHP-Ia. The authors pointed out that if imprinting occurred at a tissue- or even cellular-specific level in renal tubular cells, which would express only the maternal Gsa allele, then the genetics of PHP and PPHP could be explained. However, Williamson et al., (1996) presented data suggesting that the Gnas1 mouse homolog was maternally imprinted in glomeruli in an opposite manner to that predicted in humans.
    Pollard et al., (1994) reported a family where the father had evidence of type Ib PPHP, but at least 3 children had type II PHP. The presentation in the proband was with apparent hysterical paralysis and a bipolar mood disorder at the age of 13 years.
    It seems likely that the sibs reported by Pierquin et al., (1992) had this condition, although one sib had coronal craniosynostosis and all had metopic ridging.
    Barr et al., (1994) reported a family where an infant had normal calcium and parathormone levels in infancy, together with a normal cyclic AMP response to injected parathormone, but raised parathormone and an abnormal cyclic AMP response at the age of 2 1/2 years.
    Iiri et al., (1994) demonstrated a mutation in the alpha subunit of the G protein G(s) causing constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and the testotoxicosis phenotype (secretion of testosterone by Leydig cells in the absence of luteinizing hormone). Paradoxically the two patients with this condition also had pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia because at 37 degrees centigrade the G protein rapidly degraded.
    Note that individuals with deletions of 2q37 can have short 4th and 5th metacarpals and resemble PPHP (Wilson et al., 1995; Phelan et al., 1995). Rauch et al., (1996) and Bijlsma et al., (1999) review the clinical features of other cases with 2q37 deletions. There is a round face with deep set eyes, a bulbous nasal tip, thin vermillion border of the lips, and sparse hair. Seizures appeared to be a feature of the condition. Power et al., (1997) reported a further case with 2q37 deletion and suggested that the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (RDCI) was a possible candiate gene.

    >The cranium is relatively large and this is accentuated by a small face and micrognathia. The sclerae may be blue with exophthalmos. The nose is pinched with anteverted nares and the palate is high and grooved. The deciduous teeth may persist giving a double row of teeth. The shoulders are narrow and there may be a thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. The tips of the fingers are short and bulbous, the nails thin and hypoplastic, and the skin over the dorsum of the hands wrinkled. Radiographs reveal generalised increased bone density, multiple wormian bones, osteolysis of the distal phalanges and partial aplasia of the the distal ends of the clavicles. Characteristically the mandibular angles are absent. The main problems are short stature, dental caries, fractures of the bones and osteomyelitis. Le Bouedec et al., (1995) reported two sibs with radiological features of the condition, one of whom had a leukoerythroblastic anaemia with thrombocytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Mocan et al., (1997) reported a case with haemanigoma of the skull, but it was not obvious form the case report or radiographs published where this haemangioma was. Soliman et al., (1996) describe a good response to growth hormone treatment in 5 out of 6 cases. Darcan et al., (1996) reported a case with growth hormone deficiency.
    Gelb et al., (1995) and Polymeropoulos et al., (1995) mapped the gene to 1q21.  Gelb et al., (1996) found mutations in the cathepsin K gene which codes for a cysteine protease expressed in osteoclasts. A further nonsense mutation was reported by Johnson et al., (1996).
    Gelb et al., (1998) reported a patient with pyknodysostosis who was found to have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 1 due to a meiosis II nondisjunction event. He was of normal intelligence and just had features of pyknodysostosis.</abstract>

    >Patients are less severely affected than in achondroplasia, and the two conditions breed true. The diagnosis might be difficult in the neonatal period, despite the presence of mild rhizomelic limb shortening and some bossing of the forehead. It has been said in the past that patients with hypochondroplasia do not have frontal prominence, but this is not always so. Radiologically, the long bones are short with widened diaphyses and flared metaphyses. The fibulae seem to be disproportionately long. The phalanges are short and there are narrow interpedicular spaces. It should be noted that these findings might not be clearly evident until the second or third year of life. Although it has been suggested that 10-20% of cases might have mild mental retardation (Hall and Spranger, 1979), Wynne-Davies and Patton (1991) did not find any evidence of mental handicap in 27 cases. 
    Mullis et al., (1991) presented data that suggested that the gene for a sub-group might be located at 12q23, being either linked or identical to IGF-1. Le Merrer et al., (1994) reported weak evidence of linkage to the achondroplasia locus on 4p13 (lod score of 1.7 at 0.0 recombination). Hecht et al., (1995) reported a lod score of 2.4 at 0.0 recombination with the marker D4S115 on 4p. Stoilov et al., (1995) reported evidence that some hypochondroplasia families might not map to 4p13, thus suggesting possible genetic heterogeneity. Bellus et al., (1995) found a point mutation in the FGFR3 gene in 8 out of 14 unrelated patients. This was a C to A transversion at nucleotide 1620 causing an Asn540Lys substitution in the proximal tyrosine kinase domain. Prinos et al., (1995) reported an identical mutation in five other families. In addition a C to G transversion in the same codon was detected in another family. Rousseau et al., (1996) also showed that the gene in three families did not link to 4p16.3. In these families macrocephaly was not so obvious and the hands were normal. Also there was no metaphyseal flaring on skeletal survey. Prinster et al., (1998) studied 18 patients and found that nine had the Asn540Lys mutation. Patients with the common mutation had relative macrocephaly, more disproportion, tendency to narrowing of the interpedicular distances and a long fibula. Ramaswami et al., (1998) studied 65 cases and found a C162OA mutation leading to an Asn54OLys mutation in 43% of cases. A similar proportion of mutations were found in a Taiwanese population by Tsai et al., (1999). Cases without a mutation tended to have proportionate short stature and had a failure of the puberty growth spurt.
    Naski et al., (1996) showed that mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause a gradient of ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation in thanatophoric dysplasia, achondrogenesis and hypochondroplasia.  It should be noted that FGFR3 haplo insufficiency in the mouse results in elongation of the long bones.
    Angle et al., (1998) reported a three year old boy with the condition, with a proven C1620A mutation who had craniosynostosis leading to mild cloverleaf skull deformity.</abstract>

    >This is an autosomal dominant form of mesomelic limb shortening. The forearms are short and broad (the latter due to unusual curvature of the radius). Madelung deformity of the wrist is usually clinically apparent. Genu valgum is common. Stature is reduced to between 137 cms and 152 cms in adults. Radiographs reveal bowing of the radius and ulna, whose distal ends form a 'V' configuration between which the carpals are wedged. The ulnar styloid is usually posteriorly dislocated. In the lower limbs the tibia and fibula are short (with the latter being more severely affected). The report of Ventruto et al., (1983) might suggest the locus is at 2q32 or 8p13, but the diagnosis in that report is not certain as affected individuals did not have short stature.
    Gokhale et al., (1995)  reported a dominant pedigree where two sisters had the condition and developed Hodgkin`s disease. However other individuals with dyschondrosteosis did not have Hodgkin`s disease and some distant relatives without dyschondrosteosis developed Hodgkin`s disease. Mapping studies suggested the gene was not located at 2q or 8p.
    Rearrangements of the X chromosome involving deletions of Xp22-pter are frequently associated with Madelung deformity (Guichet et al., 1997).
    Belin et al., (1998) and Shears et al., (1998) demonstrated common deletions around the SHOX gene. Point mutations leading to likely haploinsufficiency were also demonstrated. Shears et al., (1998) showed homozygous deletion of the SHOX gene in a fetus with Langer mesomelia. Belin et al., (1998) showed that an XO fetus with features of Langer mesomelia was hemizygous for a deletion of the SHOX gene. Rowe et al., (1998) suggested that point mutations in the SHOX gene gave idiopathic short stature, however the family they reported was not described in great clinical detail and may in fact manifested Leri-Weill syndrome. The point mutation in the Rowe et al., (1998) family was the same as that seen in the Belin et al., (1998) family.

    >In the severe infantile form abnormalities are present from birth. The bones are sclerotic with poor modelling and a 'bone within bone appearance'. The long bones may have longitudinal striations and the vertebrae have an anterior vascular notch on lateral projection. Facial features become more pronounced with time and consist of macrocephaly and a square-shaped head, frontal bossing, ptosis and strabismus. Progressive pressure on cranial nerves leads to optic atrophy, deafness and facial palsy. The teeth are abnormal and decay easily. Hypochromic anaemia and pancytopenia develop and hepatosplenomegaly results. Osteomyelitis may complicate the picture. Charles and Key (1998) showed evidence for developmental delay in some cases. Prenatal diagnosis can be attempted by ultrasound or radiography (Ogur et al., 1995).
    Gerritsen et al., (1994) reviewed 33 patients and found that the median age of presentation was around 2 months, usually with ocular involvement. The probability of survival until the age of 6 years was about 30% but prognosis was worse in patients with haematological impairment before 3 months of age. Seventy-five percent of patients developed haematological or visual problems in the first year of life. Three patients had retinal degeneration and two had generalised neurodegeneration (see osteopetrosis-neuronal storage disease for this association). 
    Without treatment, death is in infancy. In some cases bone marrow transplantation has produced a remission. Gerritsen et al., (1994) report the experience of 69 cases treated by this means. Severe hypercalcaemia occurred in 24% of patients, especially those older than 2 years of age. Of those with visual impairment, 13% had improvement. High doses of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D) have been reported to cause increased bone resorption, however van Lie Peters et al., (1993) reported a patient where this treatment did not seem to have any effect. Key et al., (1995) reported that long-term therapy with recombinant interferon gamma-1b is beneficial in patients with infantile osteopetrosis. There was improvement in the manifestations of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, osteosclerosis, and infection-proneness.
    Monaghan et al., (1991) reported a case of asymptomatic, biopsy proven infantile osteopetrosis whose radiological features resolved by 28 months. Patel et al., (1992) reported a case with periventricular calcification of the brain, however it was difficult to gather whether carbonic anhydrase II deficiency was confidently ruled out.
    Dudin and Rambaud-Cousson (1993) reported two inbred families where osteopetrosis was associated with Hirschsprung disease in one case in each family. However other infants in the same families just had osteopetrosis.
    Heaney et al., (1998) mapped the gene to 11q13 in two pedigrees.</abstract>

    >In its full-blown clinical form this condition is relatively unique and easy to diagnose. The cardinal features are post-axial polydactyly, mostly involving the hands but also occasionally involving the feet, meso/acromelic shortening of the limbs, small deepset nails, multiple oral frenula and a congenital heart defect, predominantly an ASD. Digilio et al., (1997) point out that atrioventricular septal defects have also been reported. There may be neonatal teeth and, later, malpositioning or late eruption. The chest is narrow and the radiological changes are indistinguishable from Jeune's syndrome, in that the iliac bones in the pelvis are small and have a downwardly directed spike in the region of the triradiate cartilage. The long bones are short and the femora and humeri are thick and bowed. The ribs are short and the thorax is long and narrow. Gripp et al., (1996) reported a case with bilateral duplication of the ulnar ossification centre. Christian et al., (1980) and Zangwill et al., (1988) reported cases with Dandy-Walker malformation. Yapar et al., (1996) reported a case with short ribs and radiological features of Ellis-van Creveld, but with polydactyly and mucometrocolpos with a ventricular septal defect. The latter features resembled those seen in Kaufman-McKusick syndrome. Inomata et al., (1998) reported a female infant with severe radiological features of the condition who had apneic spells due to hypoplasia of the atlas.
    Polymeropoulos et al., (1996) mapped the gene to 4p16 in nine related Amish pedigrees and three other families from separate South American countries.
    Torrente et al., (1998) reported prenatal diagnosis of a case using linked markers.
    Howard et al., (1997) reported a family where the proband had features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome but other members of the family had features of Weyers syndrome segregating in an autosomal dominant fashion. The gene mapped to 4p16 close to the Ellis-van Creveld locus. Phadke et al., (1999) reported three sibs from a consanguineous  family with overlapping features between OFD type V and Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.</abstract>

    >This syndrome is characterised by joint hypermobility, multiple joint dislocations, especially of the knees, and talipes equinovarus. The mid-face is hypoplastic with a depressed nasal bridge. Cleft palate may be present. Radiographs reveal undermineralisation and overtubulation of the long bones, a bifid calcaneus and advanced bone age in the carpals, or extra carpal bones. Scoliosis, coronal clefts of the vertebrae and subluxation of the vertebrae may be found.
    There is an autosomal dominant form and a more severe autosomal recessive form. Petrella et al., (1993) reported an affected adult brother and sister pair with apparently normal parents. The sister gave birth to an affected girl, suggesting germinal mosaicism in the parents of the affected sibs. Both sibs in this report had central cataracts. Laville et al., (1994) reported 38 cases from the island of Reunion (presumed to be autosomal recessive because of the high incidence of consanguinity in the population). Amongst this group cervical spine fusion, radio-ulnar synostosis, and bifid thumbs appeared to be additional features.
    Pierquin et al., (1991) reported two unrelated patients with partial trisomy 1q and monosomy 6p with features of Larsen syndrome. Type I collagen abnormalities were suggested. Klenn and Iozzo (1991) reported a female infant with features of Larsen syndrome who also had anal atresia and a bifid uterus. Bonaventure et al., (1992) performed linkage analysis in three recessive pedigrees, from La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, segregating for a Larsen-like syndrome. There was no linkage to COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 or COL5A2. Vujic et al., (1995) mapped the gene to 3p21.1-14.1 in a large dominant pedigree. This was close to the COL7A1 locus but this gene was excluded by linkage.</abstract>

    >The limb abnormalities in this condition are variable. The thumbs are most commonly involved and they might be digitalised, absent, hypoplastic, triphalangeal or, rarely, bifid. The other fingers might be absent, or have clinodactyly or syndactyly. Moens et al., (1993) reported an unusual family where some affected individuals had postaxial or mesoaxial polydactyly. Fryns et al., (1996) showed that this family did not map to 12q (see below). The radiographic abnormalities in the hand are well reviewed by Poznanski et al., (1970). Scaphoid abnormalities are common and include hypoplasia and bipartite ossification (supposedly due to delayed fusion of the os centrale). The other carpals may be hypoplastic, enlarged, irregular or fused. The first metacarpal may have both proximal and distal epiphyses. Occasional cases have been reported with Duane anomaly.
    In an excellent study by Smith et al., (1979) the radius was involved in 22 out of 39 cases, whereas the ulna was involved in 15. More proximally, the humerus was hypoplastic in nearly a half of cases and the clavicle was sometimes anomalous. Spranger et al., (1997) demonstrated that specific muscles were hypoplastic in this condition. 
    Heart lesions are predominantly an ASD, or more rarely a VSD, but other lesions have also occurred (Sletten and Pierpont, 1996). In definite familial cases, 85% of affected individuals have heart defects.  In those cases with no structural heart defect, ECG abnormalities are common (Newbury-Ecob et al, 1996). Despite expression being variable, if wrist X-rays are taken, and the heart carefully assessed, penetrance is probably close to 100%.  Newbury-Ecob et al., (1996) provide an excellent review.
    Turleau et al., (1984) reported two patients with an interstitial 14q deletion. However Ruiz et al., (1994) excluded linkage to this region in a four generation family. Yang et al., (1990) reported a sporadic case with an inversion of chromosome 20 (p13:q13.2). Interestingly, bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) has been mapped to 14q and BMP2 to 20p (Tabas et al., 1993).
    Terrett et al., (1994), Bonnet et al., (1994) and Basson et al., (1994) demonstrated linkage to markers on 12q, however two families studied by Terrett et al., (1994) did not show this linkage. There were no clinical differences between the families and linkage heterogeneity was formally demonstrated. 
    Li et al., (1997) and Basson et al., (1997) demonstrated mutations in the TBX5 gene located at 12q21. This is a member of the brachyury (T) family. Mutations were expected to cause haploinsufficiency. Basson et al., (1999) provided some genotype/phenotype correlation. They suggest that null alleles cause substantial abnormalities in both limb and heart whereas the Gly80Arg mutation causes significant cardiac malformations with only minor skeletal abnormalities, but Arg237Gln and Arg237Trp cause extensive upper limb malformations but less significant cardiac malformations. </abstract>

    >    The most characteristic abnormality in this condition is the presence of pre-axial polydactyly of the feet, in conjunction with craniosynostosis. In the hands there is brachydactyly and syndactyly. The thumbs are often radially deviated, secondary to a double ossification centre of the proximal phalanx. Radiographs reveal hypoplasia of the middle phalanges. Mental deficiency is not always present and IQ's have ranged from 60 to 104. (Frias et al., 1978; Richieri-Costa et al., 1993). The facial features consist of a high forehead, mid-facial hypoplasia giving a flat facial profile, bilateral ptosis, epicanthic folds, anteverted nostrils and occasionally proptosis. Dental problems may arise because of the high, narrow palate. Occasionally a mixed hearing loss can occur. Diagnosis is difficult (in the absence of polydactyly) in an isolated case, but aplasia or hypoplasia of the middle phalanges is an important clue. Balci et al., (1997) reported a case diagnosed prenataly by ultrasound examination at 20 weeks. Summitt syndrome may well be the same condition.
    Note that Ward et al., (1993) reported a female infant with a de novo reciprocal translocation (46,XX,t(1;18)(p31;q11)) with preaxial polysyndactyly, craniosynostosis and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. The three sibs reported as cases of Laurence-Moon-Biedl-Bardet syndrome with cardiac defects by McLoughlin et al., (1964) most likely have Carpenter syndrome.
    Taravath and Tonsgard (1993) reported a possible case who had cerebral abnormalities. There was cerebral atrophy and marked cerebellar vermis atrophy as well as partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. There is obvious overlap here with acrocallosal syndrome (qv) but the infant did have apparent coronal craniosynostosis.</abstract>

    >This is the combination of vertical striations of the metaphyses of the long bones (osteopathia striata), a large head with sclerosis, thickening of the skull vault and a variety of variable manifestations. The latter include cleft palate, mental retardation, and sensorineural deafness or other signs of cranial nerve compression including facial paralysis. Bar-Oz et al., (1996) reported an infant who most likely had the condition who had a duodenal web, PDA and a VSD. His mother was affected. Males can be more severely affected with Pierre-Robin anomaly and death in infancy (Winter et al., 1980; Bueno et al., 1998). The lack of convincing male to male transmission has raised the possibility of X-linked inheritance.
    Konig et al., (1996) provde a good review of the literature up to 1996.  The proband in the family they report had hydrocephalus requiring shunting but had normal development.  28% of patients had mild to moderate psychomotor or speech retardation.
    It is difficult to asses the family reported by Pellegrino et al., (1997) where 4 males had osteosclerosis and brain anomalies including cerebral atrophy and internal hydrocephalus, as the radiographs shown do not show convincing striations. The mother and one sister were said to be more mildly affected, but again convincing radiographs of the long bones were not shown. It is possible that this family had a form of OPD2.
    Nakamura et al., (1998) reported a 33 year old Japanese man with a relatively severe sclerosing bone dysplasia consisting of osteopathia striata and cranial sclerosis. There was significant metaphyseal undermodeling and also bone fragility. The radiographs showed features more severe than that normally seen in osteopathia striata-cranial sclerosis.</abstract>

    >This chondrodysplasia is characterised by severe shortening of the upper and lower limbs, so that the eventual height can be as small as 3 feet. The hands and the fingers are particularly tiny, the digits resembling stubby toes. There might also be limitation of movement at various joints and polydactyly. Intelligence is normal. Terminology is a little confused by the fact that Grebe described another complex brachydactyly syndrome with fibular aplasia (see under Du Pan syndrome). Kulkarni et al., (1995) reported a very severely affected male case, the offspring of an uncle-niece mating, with severe shortening of the upper and lower limbs. In fact, in the lower limbs there was \total absence of all the bones\. Rittler and Higa (1997) reported a further severely affected case. 
    Heterozygotes can have features of brachydactyly resembling types A1, A4 and C (Thomas et al., 1997; Costa et al., 1998). Thomas et al.,  (1997) demonstrated a mutation in the CDMP1 gene (this codes for a member of the bone morphogenetic protein-BMP family). There was substitution of tyrosine for a highly conserved cystein residue. This resulted in a protein that was not secreted and is inactive, and which prevents the secretion of other related BMP family members. Mutations in the same gene cause mesomelia type Hunter-Thompson and brachydactyly type C (qv).</abstract>

    >The majority of cases with this condition do not survive the first year of life (however see the paper by McCall et al., (1994), reporting an 11-year-old survivor). The clinical picture is that of an infant with a short trunk, emphasized by the prominent anterior rib margin, and a short immobile neck. Respiratory problems are the usual cause of death. Occasionally there are urogenital abnormalities such as undescended or even absent testes, unilateral hydronephrosis and an imperforate anus. Radiologically the ribs appear fan-like or crab-like. They are fused posteriorly and the rib-vertebral articulations are close together. Other vertebral defects such as hemivertebrae can occur. Karnes et al., (1991) reviewed Jarcho-Levin and spondylocostal dysostoses. They suggested that Jarcho-Levin syndrome is characterised by fan-like ribs that are not significantly malformed and a higher incidence of neural tube defects (see also Giacoia and Say (1992) for a review of this aspect). Spondylocostal dysostosis manifests with more severe rib anomalies.
    Rodriguez et al., (1994) reported a possible case with a large thoracolumbar meningomyelocele and sacral agenesis. 
    Simpson et al., (1995) reported two cases with congenital heart disease (AV septal defect, pulmonary artery atresia, retro-oesophageal right subclavian artery, aorta arising anteriorly from the morphological right ventricle). There were also lung segmentation defects.  
    Adegboyega et al., (1996) reported a case with a VSD, an overriding aorta with a double-outlet right ventricle, absence of the ductus arteriosus, a left subclavian artery arising from the pulmonary artery and an interrupted aortic arch.  Aurora et al., (1996) reported a case with a large primum atrial septal defect and a double outlet right ventricle with an anterior pulmonary artery. Shimizu et  al., (1997) reported a 61 year old woman, supposedly with the condition, who had an ASD and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.
    Some cases have been found with the vertebral anomalies associated with Jarcho-Levin syndrome, but with additional significant pterygia of the elbows and knees (Johnson et al., 1997; Turkel et al., 1980; Chen et al., 1984). It is not certain whether this a separate subgroup.</abstract>

    >This X-linked recessive condition is caused by a defect of copper transport and metabolism. Onset is in infancy with lethargy, abnormal temperature regulation, abnormal tone and seizures. Frequently there is prematurity. The face is said to be characteristic with pallor, full cheeks, tangled eyebrows and a pronounced cupid's bow to the upper lip. The hair may be normal at birth but becomes depigmented, thin and brittle. Microscopic analysis reveals pili torti. An alternative description for the hair abnormality is 'steely' hair. Neurological deterioration is progressive and death occurs before the age of 3. Aynaci et al., (1997) reported a case with cerebellar vermian hypoplasia and deafness. An MRI will show cortical and cerebellar atrophy with secondary subdural collections, and bizarre vascular tortuosity  (Leventer et al., 1997). Pathological examination of the brain reveals neuronal degeneration, gliosis, optic degeneration and tortuous arteries with an abnormal intima and occlusion. 
    There is intracellular accumulation of copper in cultured cells, due to impaired outflow. This is the basis of diagnostic and prenatal tests. Prenatal diagnosis can be carried out on chorionic villi, but the results are very susceptible to exogenous copper contamination. Carrier detection can also be attempted, but is subject to the usual problems with non-random X inactivation. Tumer et al., (1994) reported prenatal diagnosis by direct DNA analysis. Kaler and Tumer (1998) review prenatal diagnosis in Menkes syndrome.
    The gene maps to Xq13 close to PGK. Females with an apparently balanced X;autosome translocation have been reported (Kapur et al., 1987; Sugio et al., 1998) Chelly et al., (1993), Vulpe et al., (1993) and Mercer et al., (1993) reported the isolation of a candidate gene. There was homology with bacterial heavy metal binding protein genes and was most similar to a copper-transporting ATPase. Tumer and Horn (1997) provide a good review of the clinical and molecular aspects.
    Therapy with subcutaneous administration of copper-histidine has been attempted. Sarkar et al., (1993) review the long-term results in seven patients, two of whom were thought to have done well neurologically as a result of the treatment. If delivery is induced at 35 weeks and treatment commenced then, neurological features may be much milder, but the patients develop features of occipital horn syndrome. Similar results were obtained by Christodoulou et al., (1998) in four patients. Tumer et al (1996) show that two treated patients with this phenotype originally reported by Sarkar et al., (1993) have potentially lethal mutations in the Menkes gene.  Kaler (1996) suggests that not every infant with classical Menkes disease will have the same level of benefit from early copper-histidine treatment.
    Occasional patients have been reported with a milder form of the condition, presenting with ataxia (Danks et al., 1988; Procopis et al., 1981). Proud et al., (1996) stressed that some cases have clinical overlap with occipital horn syndrome and indeed mutations in the Menkes gene have been described in the latter condition.</abstract>

    >    This condition combines frontonasal dysplasia with craniosynostosis. The clinical features are, therefore, severe hypertelorism, a broad bifid nose, frontal bossing (which might be asymmetrical), a low posterior hairline with an anterior widow's peak, and occasionally a cleft lip and palate. If the palate is intact it is often high with widely spaced teeth and mal-eruption. Neck webbing, rounded shoulders, abnormal clavicles and raised scapulae are all features. In the limbs there is often longitudinal splitting of the nails, occasionally skin syndactyly, and the fingers and toes might be deviated distally or, occasionally, hypoplastic. Most children have a normal intelligence, although mild delay has been reported. There are more females reported than males. Radiographs of the skull show premature coronal synostosis. Males may be less severely affected than females and Devriendt et al., (1995) reported this phenomenon in a mother and son. Grutzner et al., (1988) suggested that inheritance is X-linked dominant, but could not explain why females were more severely affected than males. Natarajan et al., (1993) reported the syndrome in two male sibs with normal parents. 
    Kapusta et al., (1992) reported seven classical cases of the condition. One case was male. In two fathers of female cases there were mild features of the condition.
    McPherson et al., (1991), in an abstract, reported a female with a del(X)(p22.2)-&lt;pter with features of the condition. Note that Ward et al., (1993) reported a female infant with a de novo reciprocal translocation (46,XX,t(1;18)(p31;q11)) with preaxial polysyndactyly, craniosynostosis and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum.
    Mulvihill et al., (1993) reported a family with features of craniofrontonasal dysplasia. An interstitial deletion of 10p with breakpoints at p11.21 and p11.23 was found in three affected family members who were tested.
    Cantrell et al., (1994), Reardon et al., (1990) and Webster and Deming (1950) reported probable cases with unilateral absence of the pectoralis major muscle (ie. features of Poland anomaly). Erdogan et al., (1996) also reported a case with this association. There was polythelia of the left breast. Saavedra et al., (1996) reported 41 cases from Mexico of whom 35 were female and 6 were male.  Most cases were sporadic but there were 7 familial cases.  Unusual manifestations that were noted included thick wiry and curly hair with irregularities in disposition of keratin filaments on scanning EM, anterior cranium bifidum, axillary pterygia, unilateral breast hypoplasia, and asymmetric lower limbs.
    Feldman et al., (1997) mapped the gene to Xp22 and noted the association with cleft lip and palate in 4 out of 12 affected males (1 with a pseudo cleft). The main manifestation in males was otherwise just hypertelorism. Pulleyn et al., (1999) provide further evidence for linkage to Xp22 region. </abstract>

    >This is the association between polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cutaneous pigmentation and precocious puberty. The fibrous dysplasia may involve any bone, although some sites are preferentially affected, such as the upper end of the femur. Involvement of long bones results in bowing, pain and sometimes fractures. Involvement of the bones of the skull results in facial asymmetry, prognathism and proptosis. Fibrous dysplasia of the skull may cause encroachment of the optic nerve. Bocca et al., (1998) suggest that aggressive intervention is indicated in these cases where there is acute visual loss. Radiographs of the skull may reveal hyperostosis. Cafe au lait spots of the skin are characteristic; they are usually large and are distributed asymmetrically with an irregular border. Rieger et al., (1994) suggest that in some cases the macules can follow the lines of Blaschko. Oral pigmentation can occur. There have been reports of cases associated with soft tissue myxomas, especially of muscle (reviewed by Gober and Nicholas, 1993). Schwartz et al., (1996) reported a 52-year-old man with fibrous dysplasia of the scalp. Yu et al., (1995) reported a case who had a linear sebaceous naevus, a corneal opacity, a conjunctival dermoid, and a coloboma of the upper eyelid. Rustin et al., (1989) also reported a case with a linear sebaceous naevus. In childhood this man was treated for rickets because radiographs of the pelvis and femora showed numerous Looser's zones and he had persistent hypophosphataemia.
    Precocious puberty occurs in 50% of affected females and in some males. Hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome are complications. When this occurs in the neonatal period the bone lesions may not be typical and there may be diffuse osteoporosis without obvious fibrous dysplasia (personal observation; Shenker et al., 1993) or widening of metaphyses with scattered irregular lucencies in the vertebrae, pelvis and long bones (Yoshimoto et al., 1991). 
    There are no convincing examples of familial cases in the literature. Alvarez-Arratia et al., (1983) reported a case where several of the family members had cafe au lait spots and subtle radiological abnormalities, however the evidence was not convincing that the condition was monogenic in this family.
    The condition is caused by somatic mutation of the GNAS1 gene for the alpha-subunit of G-protein, leading to overactivity of adenylyl cyclase (Schwingdinger et al., 1992). Mutations in the same gene have also been found in monostotic fibrous dysplasia (Shenker et al., 1995). Loss of function of the same gene leads to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (qv). Pienkowski et al., (1998) reported a case with a mosaic GNAS1 mutation where the only manifestation was an recurrent ovarian cyst.  
    Candeliere et al., (1995) studied 8 patients with various forms of fibrous dysplasia and found high levels of c-fos expression in bone lesions. This proto-oncogene codes for a nuclear protein that is part of the transcription factor AP-1. Two of the patients had GNS1 mutations. The authors concluded that increased adenylate cyclase activity causes increased expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.
    Liens et al., (1994) reported treatment of eight patients with McCune-Albright syndrome with pamidronate. Decreased bone pain was reported and four cases showed radiological evidence of thickening of cortices and refilling of osteolytic lesions.</abstract>

    >Fronto-metaphyseal dysplasia can be suspected clinically by the bony overgrowth involving the supraorbital ridges, giving a visor-like appearance. Height is normal but the tibiae are curved backwards, with a mild valgus deformity at the knees. Progressive contractures develop in the digits and extension and rotation is limited at the elbows. Muscles tend to be thin and wasted. Deafness and cranial nerve entrapment occur. Radiologically the skull has a helmet appearance and there is patchy sclerosis, as well as the overgrowth of the supraorbital ridges. The paranasal sinuses might be obliterated. The ribs are thin and irregular and the tibiae and fibulae are wavy and bowed. The carpal bones might be fused and in general the bones are undermodelled. An obstructive uropathy is reported to occur. Nishimura et al., (1995) reported the findings in a neonate.  Inheritance is most likely X-linked, but this is not certain.
    Reardon et al., (1991) reported a brother and sister who may have had this condition. The girl was less severely affected than the boy. Against the diagnosis was developmental delay, absence of genu recurvatum and a prominent mandible in both sibs. Mental retardation is rarely a feature of fronto-metaphyseal dysplasia - Jervis et al., (1975) reported two maternal half-brothers with this combination, however they were severely microcephalic and may have had a separate condition. 
    Note that the case reported by Danks et al., (1972) has also been written up as a case of oto-palato-digital syndrome by Superti-Furga et al., (1987). There is considerable overlap between these two conditions. There is also overlap with Melnick-Needles syndrome. Glass and Rosenbaum (1995) wrote up a mother and two affected sons who demonstrated this overlap. The sons died in the neonatal period of congenital heart disease (single AV valve, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary atresia, tricuspid atresia, atrial septal defect). Franceschini et al., (1997) reported a male with features of the condition who also had a tracheoesophageal fistula. The authors provide a good review of extra-skeletal manifestations in this condition.</abstract>

    >This type of brachydactyly is rare but, when reported, seems to be dominant. The characteristic finding is of a short index finger and 2nd toe. Radiologically, the short digits have a triangular or delta-shaped middle phalanx and clinically when the lesion is severe the index finger and 2nd toe might be curved radially. 5th finger clinodactyly is common, and the big toe is often short and broad.
   Pfeiffer et al., (1997) reported an infant with some features of brachydactyly A2 (short middle phalanges, particularly the second). There was a deletion of 15q25.2 and duplication of 20p12.2 due to a maternal reciprocal translocation.</abstract>

    >    The facial and skeletal changes are the most characteristic. The eyes slope downwards and there is telecanthus and synophrys. Later optic atrophy can develop. In addition the philtrum is long and the nostrils are anteverted. A skull X-ray will show wormian bones, an elongated pituitary fossa and a thickened cranium with persistent sutures. There is progressive basilar invagination. There is a discrepancy in the length of the paired long bones, resulting in valgus at the knees or dislocation of the radial heads. The classical acro-osteolysis only develops in late childhood, and it should be noted that the toes are only partially affected, leading to a triangular shape of the distal phalanges. The vertebrae can be variable in height, and there may be progressive, biconcave, \fishbone\ flattening due to progressive osteoporosis. Kaplan et al., (1995) suggested that polycystic renal disease is found in 10% of patients. They described two cases with overlapping features with the Serpentine fibula syndrome, and in fact suggest that this is the same condition. Fryns (1997) makes the same point.
    Rosser et al., (1996) reported two brothers and a sister who had features of the condition.  One brother had an XXY carrier type.  In the other the karyotype was not carried out.  One case had a convincing serpentine fibula.  The overlap between serpentine fibula syndrome, ter Haar syndrome, and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome was noted.  Both males died in the first year of life from respiratory failure.  Two cases had intestinal malrotation. One case had an iris coloboma.
    Ades et al., (1993) reported a case with Arnold-Chiari malformation. Fryns et al., (1997) reported a 36 year old man with features of the condition who had vocal cord paralysis. Cystic kidney disease was also demonstrated.

    >    This is the commonest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Affected individuals may have blue sclerae with a tendency to fractures of the long bones, although healing occurs without deformity. In some families dentinogenesis imperfecta is a feature.
    Cells from individuals with type I OI secrete about half the normal amount of type I procollagen (Wenstrup et al., 1990; Prockop, 1992), and the disorder has been linked to one of the type I collagen loci in most families (Sykes, 1993). Sykes et al., (1990) showed that pedigrees linked to COL1A1 were more likely to show presenile hearing loss. Willing et al., (1994) reported seven different COL1A1 mutations in individuals with type I OI and reviewed the literature on the molecular basis of this condition. Korkko et al., (1998) studied fifteen patients by heteroduplexes analysis of genomic DNA and found disease causing mutations in thirteen with likely mutations in the remaining two. All mutations were in the COL1A1 gene.
    Levin et al., (1985) reported thirteen individuals from three families with a dominant form of osteogenesis imperfecta. There were multilocular radiolucent, radiopaque lesions of the maxilla and mandible as well as diffuse osteopenia. It was felt that these families may represent a separate form of the condition.
    The diagnosis of \temporary brittle bone disease\ in cases of suspected non-accidental injury (Paterson et al., 1993) should be made with extreme caution. Steiner et al., (1996) discussed the use of collagen synthesis studies in differentiating osteogenesis imperfecta from child abuse.  Cells from 6 of 48 children suspected of child abuse showed biochemical signs of OI.  However in 5 of these there were obvious clinical signs.  The authors conclude that \when diagnostic uncertainty persists in cases of suspected child abuse, biochemical studies may be a useful adjunct, but routine biopsy for children suspected to have been abused is unwarranted\.</abstract>

    >The main features of this condition are craniostenosis, broad thumbs and great toes, and variable soft tissue syndactyly. In the feet the halluces are characteristically in the varus position. Craniostenosis usually affects the coronal sutures, but a clover-leaf skull can also be seen. The facies resemble Crouzon syndrome. Radiographs of the hands and feet reveal brachymesophalangy, broad distal phalanges, deformed proximal phalanges of the thumbs and great toes, symphalangism and a broad or duplicated first metatarsal. Ohashi et al., (1993) reported a case with anal atresia.  It is difficult to evaluate the case with coronal craniosynostosis, anal atresia and syndactyly of toes 2 and 3 reported by Pfeiffer et al., (1996) because no photos were published.
    Cohen (1993) recognises three subtypes. Type 1 is the classic form as reported by Pfeiffer. Type 2 has a cloverleaf skull together with ankylosis of the elbows (Plomp et al., 1998; Robin et al., 1998). Type 3 is similar to type 2, but without a cloverleaf skull and with severe proptosis. Types 2 and 3 have a poor prognosis for survival but mental development may not be severely affected (Robin et al., 1998). Cases with cloverleaf skull are usually sporadic. Martinelli et al., (1997) reported a case with subtype 2 diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound because of the cloverleaf skull. The case reported by Soekarman et al., (1992) of a boy with apparent cloverleaf skull whose mother was affected with classic Pfeiffer syndrome may not be an exception, as the cranial abnormalities were not as severe as usually seen in classic cloverleaf skull abnormality.
    Muenke et al., (1994) showed that mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) gene caused Pfeiffer syndrome in a proportion of families. This gene maps to 8p11.2-p12 (Robin et al., 1994). Mutations in five unrelated families were found - all the same. There was a C to G transversion in exon 5 causing a proline to arginine substitution in the link between the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains of the extracellular portion of the molecule. Rutland et al., (1995) and Lajeunie et al., (1995) reported mutations in the B exon of FGFR2 in cases of Pfeiffer syndrome with relatively severe skull abnormalities. All the cases were isolated. Five cases were shown to have a T to C transition at nucleotide 1036 resulting in the replacement of a cysteine by an arginine. This mutation has previously been observed in a single case of Crouzon syndrome. Park et al., (1995) reported a sporadic case with an identical mutation. They interpreted the phenotype as being that of Jackson-Weiss syndrome, but it was the same as the Rutland and Lajeunie cases (see Jackson-Weiss syndrome for comment on \sporadic\ Jackson-Weiss syndrome). A further replacement of the same cysteine by tyrosine in another case has been reported in three cases of Crouzon syndrome. Schafer et al., (1998) reported a case of Pfeiffer syndrome type 2 with a TRP290 cys mutation in FGFR2 that had previously been reported a patient with a Crouzon phenotype. Schell et al., (1995) found similar mutations in the FGFR2 gene.  Meyers et al., (1996) showed further mutations in the FGFR2 gene in cases with Crouzon, Pfeiffer and 'Jackson-Weiss' phenotypes.  In one family with a novel exon IIIc mutation (valine 359 phenyalanine) the proband and his father exhibited classical features of Crouzon syndrome whereas the paternal aunt resembled Pfeiffer syndrome with broad thumbs and great toes. Passos-Bueno et al., (1997) reported a case with severe syndactyly and duplication of the hallex-interpreted as an 'apert-like phenotype' who had an A to G transition at the 3' acceptor splice site of the intron adjacent to exon B of FGFR2. Gripp et al., (1998) reported a case with type 3 who had a Ser351Cys mutation of FGFR2. Cornejo-Roldan et al., (1999) reported further mutations in the FGFR2 gene in Pfeiffer syndrome. Okajima et al., (1999) reported three patients with a severe form of the condition who had anterior chamber anomalies. An FGFR2Ser351Cys mutation was found in all of them. Other cases in the literature have not had this feature. 
    The infant reported by Sagehashi (1992) with craniosynostosis, \deformation of thumbs\, choanal stenosis, a cartilaginous trachea and a caudal appendage most likely has Pfeiffer syndrome. The case reported by Cantrell et al., (1994) most likely has Pfeiffer syndrome.</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This is a variable syndrome, to the extent that cryptophthalmos might not be present in all cases. However, the main features are a \hidden eye\, syndactyly and abnormal genitalia. The cryptophthalmos might be bilateral, unilateral or asymmetrical. Pankau et al., (1994) reported a probable case with anophthalmia. Usually the globe is present under the fused eyelids. Cryptophthalmos is frequently accompanied by an absence of eyebrows and eyelashes, and the covering skin might extend from the forehead to the cheeks. A tongue of hair can extend from the anterior hairline to the outer margin of the orbit. The nose is broad, with a flat bridge, and may have a groove at the tip or a coloboma of the nares. The external ear may be malformed or low-set. Stenosis of the external auditory meatus should be sought. Laryngeal stenosis, renal agenesis, and genital abnormalities (hypospadias, clitoromegaly) are common. Andiran et al., (1999) reported a male case with anterior urethral atresia. Stevens et al., (1994) reported sibs with pulmonary hyperplasia. The syndactyly involves only skin. Mental retardation occurs in 80% of survivors. Cryptophthalmos may also occur without other malformations - see Ghose et al., (1988) for a general review. Fryns et al., (1997) report prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound scans in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy.
    There is possible homology to mouse \bleb\ mutants (Winter, 1990; Darling and Gossler, 1994). In these mice blebs occur early in development and appear to interfere mechanically with the development of eyelids and limb buds - renal agenesis is also seen. </abstract>

    >This autosomal recessive craniotubular bone dysplasia mainly spares the skull but affects the ribs, clavicles, pelvis and long bones. Genu valga becomes apparent in childhood and there may be a prominent supraorbital skull ridge with mild hyperostosis of the vault. Muscular weakness may be a feature of the condition. Radiographs reveal thickening of affected bones and mild platyspondyly. The long bones, particularly the femur, have an Erlenmeyer flask deformity (flaring of the metaphyses with diaphyseal endostosis).</abstract>

    >This condition differs clinically from Marshall-Stickler by the absence of myopia, which has not been reported in eleven cases (Kaariainen et al., 1993). One family reported by Miny and Lenz (1985) consisted of two sibs who were the offspring of consanguineous parents, suggesting that this might be an autosomal recessive, compared to Marshall-Stickler which is dominant. Al Gazali and Lytle (1994) also reported three affected sibs with normal parents. The other possible differentiating feature is the presence of limited mobility of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints and, possibly, the greater involvement of the vertebral bodies. The long bone changes are similar to those found in Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, which is probably not separate from the Marshall-Stickler syndrome.
    It is not certain whether the cases reported by Chemke et al., (1992) fall into this group. See Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome for a discussion of this paper.
    Vikkula et al., (1995) and van Steensel et al., (1997) reported a sibship where three individuals had features of this syndrome. A glycine to arginine substitution was demonstrated in the COL11A2 gene. It is of interest that the COL11A2 gene product is not expressed in the mammalian vitreous, as it is replaced by the alpha2 chain of type V collagen.
    Pihlajamaa et al., (1998) demonstrated a mutation in the COL11A2 gene in the patient originally described as having Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (qv) (Weissenbacher and Zweymuller 1964). This would suggest that the Weissenbacher-Zweymuller phenotype can be part of OSMED syndrome. </abstract>

    >    This term was proposed by Maroteaux in 1969, to describe a mild short trunk dwarfism with generalised platyspondyly which involved cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions. In the anterio-posterior projection the bodies extended laterally beyond the lateral margin of the pedicles and the end plates were irregular. The iliac bones were slightly short and the femoral necks were short and broad. In one patient the greater trochanters were prominent. Tubular bones were mildly short and in the femoral necks and the distal radial and ulnar metaphyses there were linear densities. Horton et al., (1983) reported three sibs with what they called the Hobaek type (Hobaek, 1961). In a similar sibship published by Toledo et al., (1978) the four sibs had corneal opacities; this may be a separate condition (q.v.).
    Shohat et al., (1989) have classified cases with 'Brachyolmia' into four groups. Types Maroteaux and Hobaek are both autosomal recessive but in the former type there is less rounding of the anterior and posterior vertebral borders, less lateral extension of the vertebral bodies in the AP projection and precocious calcification of the falx. In the same paper a dominant form with severe generalized platyspondyly and irregularities of the cervical spine was reported - the Toledo type was the fourth group.
    Lang et al., (1991) reported two affected sisters who also had short 4th metacarpals. They came from a family where a form of vitreoretinal dystrophy appeared to be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Gardner and Beighton (1994) reported a mother and son with an apparently dominant form of the condition. Soua et al., (1994) reported four affected brothers, the offspring of consanguineous parents, who had short stature and scoliosis and features of brachyolmia. The face was described as flattened with enlarged lips. The facial description sounds similar to the cases reported under Huson (1993) (qv).</abstract>

    >GENERAL
    Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) was thought to have a prevalence of about 1 in 30-50,000, however recent studies suggest that this might be as high as 1 in 6,000 (Webb and Osborne, 1995; Ahlsen et al., 1994). However, note that Norio et al., (1996) found depigmented macules, larger than 10 mm in diameter in 23% of normal adults and 12% of normal children.  The first abnormal skin lesion might be a depigmented macule or a tuft of white hair. The characteristic warty macules ('adenoma sebaceum') appear in childhood. These are angiofibromas. They occur around the nasolabial folds and butterfly region around the nose, but are said to spare the upper lip. Note that multiple facial angiofibromas and collagenomas resembling the skin lesions seen in tuberous sclerosis can be seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Darling et al., 1997). Shagreen patches may be seen, especially in the lumbosacral region. These are raised plaques of thickened slightly pigmented skin. Skin tags around the neck and cafe au lait spots may also be present. A search should be made for gingival fibromas, pits in the enamel of the teeth (Flanagan et al., 1997) (although doubt has been expressed about the usefulness of this sign by Webb et al., 1994), periungual fibromas and ocular phakomata. 
    Fryer et al., (1990) summarise the frequency of various manifestations of the disorder. Hypopigmented macules and facial angiomas occur in up to 90% of cases, shagreen patches in 20-40%, ungual fibromas in up to 50%, subependymal nodules on CT scan in 90% with cortical lesions in 50%, renal angiolipomas in 60%, renal cysts in 20%, radiological abnormalities of the bones (sclerotic patches, pseudocysts, periosteal new bone formation) in 60%, poliosis in 20%, gum fibromas in 10%, and dental pits in 70%. Giant cell astrocytomas of the brain can occur in about 5% of individuals. These commonly obstruct the exit of the third ventricle and present with vomiting, visual loss, headaches, ataxia and behavioural change.
    Cook et al., (1996) looked in more detail at the prevalence of renal abnormalities in the condition.  In a series of 139 cases they found that 61% had renal involvement.  Angiomyolipomas were detected in 49%, renal cysts in 32% and renal carcinomas in 2.2%.  The presence of angiomyolipomas correlated with age.  The authors recommend routine ultrasound scans in all patients with tuberous sclerosis which should be repeated every five years if no abnormality is found.  If angiomyolipomas are present the authors recommend follow up scans every 1 or 2 years.
    Cardiac rhabdomyomata are said to be characteristic of the condition (Groves et al., 1992). Harding and Pagon (1990) suggest that at least 51% of infants with a cardiac rhabdomyoma have TS but Webb and Osborne (1992) point out that this is likely to be a considerable underestimate. Jozwiak et al., (1994) demonstrated rhabdomyomas in 22 out of 47 children with tuberous sclerosis. Tumours were more frequent in children below 2 years of age (91% of cases had tumours). Tumour regression was documented in 6 out of 12 children followed up. However, Webb et al., (1992) concluded, from investigating 60 parents of children with TS and 60 controls, that echocardiography is not an investigation of high specificity - 2 parents had bright echodense areas interpreted as possible rhabdomyomas and 3 controls had similar findings. Di Mario et al., (1996) document the natural history of rhabdomyoma in tuberous sclerosis. These tumours tend to regress. 
    O'Callaghan et al., (1998) reported an association with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in Tuberous sclerosis. This tends to manifest in the first year of life and can cause supraventricular tachycardia. However, 9 out of 10 cases were associated with cardiac rhabdomyomata.
    Webb et al., (1993) review polycystic kidney disease in tuberous sclerosis, pointing out that this can manifest before the other features of the condition, and mimic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Brook-Carter et al., (1994) demonstrated deletions of the tuberous sclerosis and adult polycystic kidney disease genes on chromosome 16 in six cases of tuberous sclerosis presenting with polycystic renal disease in infancy. However it is likely that not all renal cysts found in cases of tuberous sclerosis are associated with adult polycystic kidney disease gene mutations. Sampson et al., (1997) studied 27 cases with Tuberous sclerosis and renal cystic disease. They found that 17 patients had constitutional deletions of the TSC2 and PKD1 gene. One patient had a partial deletion of the PKD1 gene and 4 patients had somatic mosaicism.
    Unbiased studies have suggested that seizures occur in 60% of cases and mental retardation in about 40% (Webb et al., 1991). The degree of seizures and mental retardation may correlate with the number of cortical lesions found on brain imaging (Roach 1997, Goodman et al., 1997). Webb et al., (1996) further review the neuological complications of the condition.
    Essential investigations in patients are a CT or MRI scan (Inoue et al., 1998) and renal and cardiac ultrasound. Bradshaw et al., (1998) outline a suggestive management plan for affected individuals. Fryer et al., (1990) discuss the investigations that should be offered to parents and sibs of an apparently isolated case. They conclude that the most important procedure is a good clinical and ophthalmological examination. If this is normal a cranial CT scan is unlikely to show abnormalities, and might be difficult to interpret. Renal ultrasound and skeletal radiographs are not helpful. Recurrence risks to normal parents of an isolated case are less than 5%, but not negligible. Rose et al., (1999) provide evidence to suggest that a recurrence risk of 2-3% after a sporadic case of tuberous sclerosis, is appropriate.
UNUSUAL CASES
    Very occasionally localised hypertrophy of a limb can occur (Reddy et al., 1992). Maloof et al., (1994) reported an infant whose mother was affected and who had hemimegalencephaly and some features of tuberous sclerosis (evidence of cardiac rhabdomyomas, depigmented macules).  McGrae and Hashimoto (1996) reported a 23-year-old female with unilateral facial angiofibromas, but no other features of tuberous sclerosis.  They suggested that this was a segmental form of tuberous sclerosis caused by a meiotic mutation.
    One percent of patients develop lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lungs. This consists of diffuse proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Lung transplantation is the only consistent therapy. Characteristically these patients are females of reproductive age. Because of the association with oral contraceptive medication, gonadotropin therapy, and menarche and pregnancy, treatment with progesterone or tamoxifen has been suggested (reviewed by Scully et al., 1994). Renal angiomyolipomas can occur in about 50% of patients with isolated lymphangiomoymatosis. Smolarek et al., (1998) demonstrated loss of heterozygosity for markers around the TSC2 gene in angiomyolipomas from such patients.
    Ruggieri et al., (1997) reported a very unusual family where the parents were first cousins but unaffected by extensive tests. Three children died in the neonatal period  with features of TS. They had congestive heart failure probably due in all cases to intracavity rhabdomyomas. Another sib was alive at the age of 24 months and more mildly affected. Linkage studies in a severely affected sib did not show evidence of homozygosity for markers around TSC1 ant TSC2 genes.
GENETICS   
    There is evidence that mutations at more than one locus can give rise to the condition. In about 50% of families the gene maps to 9q34 and the remainder seem to map to 16p (Kandt et al., 1992; Povey et al., 1994). It has been suggested that in some families the gene maps to 11q14-11q22 and 12q22-12q24 but this seems to have been refuted (Sampson and Harris, 1994; Janssen et al., 1994). The gene on 16p (TSC2) has been identified and has homology to the GTPase-activating protein GAP3 (Nellist et al., 1993). Wilson et al., (1996) found mutations in the TSC2 gene in about 25% of sporadic cases by screening the gene with SSCP. van Bakel et al., (1997) found mutations in 28% of cases in a series of 18 and suggested that about half of these might have been caused by the TSC2 gene. Maheshwar et al., (1997) found mutations the TSC2 gene in about 10% of cases. Missense mutations in exons 36, 37, and 38 occurred in 8 cases. These exons codes the GAP-related domain. Au et al., (1998) looked at 90 cases (56 sporadic and 34 familial) and found 22 mutations (24%). In the sporadic group 32% of mutations were found and in the familial group 9%. Further mutations in the first third of the TSC2 gene were reported by Jobert et al., (1997). Young et al., (1998) studied 79 unrelated patients with tuberous sclerosis and found a TSC1 mutation in 27 cases. Kwiatkowska et al., (1998) studied 13 families linked to the TSC1 region, 22 families without linkage information, and 126 sporadic cases. Mutations in the TSC1 gene were found in 54%, 5% and 10% of cases respectively. Jones et al., (1999) studied 150 familial and sporadic cases by heteroduplex and SSCP analysis, as well as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis for large rearrangement and found mutations in 80% of which about 20% had TSC1 mutations and 80% TSC2 mutations.
    Green et al., (1994) demonstrated loss of heterozygosity for 16p13.3 in hamartomas from tuberous sclerosis patients, including angiomyolipomas, a cardiac rhabdomyoma, a cortical tuber and a giant cell astrocytoma. Carbonara et al., (1994) and Green et al., (1994) provided evidence that the TS gene at 9q34 also acts as a tumour suppressor. 
     van Slegtenhorst et al., (1997) identified the TSC1 gene at 9q34. It codes for a 130 kilodalton protein named hamartin that has homology to a putative yeast protein of unknown function. 32 mutations were identified, 30 of which were truncating. In one patient a somatic mutation of the wild-type allele in a renal carcinoma suggesting the protein is a tumour suppressor. One mutation (2105delAAG) was seen in 6 unrelated patients. Jones et al., (1997) looked for TSC1and TSC2 mutations in a 171 cases and found TSC1 mutations in 7 out of 24 familial cases but only 13 out of 147 sporadic cases. In contrast TSC2 mutations were found in two of the familial cases and 45 of the sporadic cases. Ali et al., (1998) studied 83 cases of tuberous sclerosis and found TSC1 mutations in 16 (19%). In ten cases predicted to have TSC1 mutations by linkage analysis, mutations were identified in 8.  Ali et al., (1998) estimate that TSC1 mutations account for 24% of all tuberous sclerosis patients.  Mental retardation was significantly less frequent in carriers of the TSC1 mutations suggesting ascertainment bias for TSC2 mutations in sporadic cases. van Slegtenhorst et al., (1999) found mutations in 13% of a cohort of 225 tuberous sclerosis patients. 
    Yates et al., (1997) demonstrated apparent maternal germline mosaicism in a family where 3 affected sibs had a TSC2 mutation. Verhoef et al., (1999) studied 62 unrelated families and found evidence of gonadal or somatic mosaicism for the TSC1 gene or TSC2 gene in five families where a parent was mildly affected, and one family with clinically unaffected parents.

    >    Also called the median cleft face syndrome, the main features are marked hypertelorism, sometimes with narrowing of the palpebral fissures, in conjunction with a broad nasal tip which is frequently cleft. Notching of the alae nasi might be a feature. The occurrence of a widow's peak and an occasional anterior encephalocele emphasizes the midline nature of this syndrome. Other involvement of the CNS is unusual, although mental retardation and an agenesis of the corpus callosum have been described - Pascual-Castroviejo et al., (1985) described a case with a lipoma of the corpus callosum and Srinivasa et al., (1990) described a similar case with a frontal encephalocele. An anterior cranium bifidum may be detected on skull X-ray. The ears are usually normal but pre-auricular ear tags and low-set ears have been reported. Roarty et al., (1994) reviewed ophthalmological anomalies in 23 patients with frontonasal dysplasia. These included strabismus, nystagmus, ptosis of the eyelids, optic nerve hypoplasia and colobomas, microphthalmia, cataract and corneal dermoids. Grubben et al., (1990) reported a case with a coloboma of the optic disc associated with a sphenoethmoidal encephalocele. A further case had similar features with growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism of central origin. These cases seem to overlap with cases reported with 'morning glory syndrome and sphenoethmoidal encephalocele' (qv). Hennekam et al., (1986) reported a case with a frontal encephalocele, a frontal midline skull lipoma, a congenital hypothalamic hamartoma, and a VSD and PDA.  Stelnicki et al., (1995) reported a female with a variant form of the condition where the nose was displaced to the right side of the face and the left orbit contained two globes.  
    Fryburg et al., (1993) reported a family where a mother had features of frontonasal dysplasia and had two sons with the condition. Her brother was also affected. There seems to be good evidence for autosomal or X-linked dominant inheritance in this family. Most cases of frontonasal dysplasia are sporadic, but the authors review the literature on other rare familial cases.
    Meguid (1993) reported a case, the offspring of Egyptian first cousins, where there was an associated lipoma of the corpus callosum and Fallot's tetralogy.
    Stevens and Qumsiyeh (1995) reported a case with an apparently balanced de novo translocation involving chromosomes 3, 7 and 11. Breakpoints were at 3q27, 3q23, 7q21.3, and 11q21. Additional features were an ASD, micropenis, clubfeet, scoliosis and cervical vertebral fusions. MRI scanning showed severe neuronal migration abnormalities with an absent corpus callosum and absence of the gyral pattern of the left hemisphere. </abstract>

    >    Clinically the patients are very small with a short trunk and marked lordosis. Myopia, cleft palate and deafness can occur. Onset is at birth, but severe short stature may not be obvious until 2-3 years. In infancy the vertebral bodies are ovoid or pear-shaped but later platyspondyly with irregular endplates develops. Odontoid hypoplasia may be a problem. Bone age is markedly delayed and the epiphyses are flattened and fragmented. The capital femoral epiphysis is severely affected. Delay in ossification of the pubic rami is characteristic. 
    The condition may be separated into two types according to the presence of severe coxa vara or not (Wynne-Davies and Hall, 1982). In the former case, short stature is severe with a final height of between three and four feet. In the latter case final height might be between four and five feet.
    Congenital hypothyroidism should be ruled out as occasionally this can mimic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (Eberle, 1993; Wiedemann, 1994).
    Anderson, Goldberg et al., (1990) demonstrated linkage to COL2A1 in a four generation pedigree, however in another family with a milder autosomal dominant form of SED congenita they could not demonstrate linkage (Anderson, Tsipouras et al., 1990). 
    In contrast Ramesar and Beighton (1992) reported linkage to COL2A1 in a relatively mildly affected family. Tiller et al., (1990) and Cole et al., (1993) reported mutations in the COL2A1 and COL2A2 genes respectively. Tiller et al., (1995) reported an RNA-splicing mutation in COL2A1.</abstract>

    >The original papers of Cantu et al., (1976) and (1977) reported a male who was the offspring of consanguineous parents. He had a birth weight of 3.2 kg and was short. His further development was characterised by short stature and a dolichocephalic skull with a prominent forehead. His development was said to be normal. He had bilateral epicanthic folds, an entropion, a short nose with a depressed nasal bridge and a small jaw. His ears were large and low-set, and his neck and trunk were short. He had a marked pectus carinatum. Both his liver and his spleen were enlarged. His forearms and hands were short, and in his lower limbs there was acromesomelic shortening. His X-rays showed generalized platyspondyly and the tubular bones were thick and short, especially the forearm bones. The metacarpals and phalanges were osteoporotic, short and wide.</abstract>

    >    The skin lesions are variable. There is congenital skin hypoplasia, which might be extensive and often involves the scalp. The skin lesions are often bilateral but asymmetrical over both lower limbs, initially red in colour, patchy and of different shapes and sizes. Later, fat might herniate through the areas of atrophy. In addition there are often areas of linear or reticular hyper- or hypopigmentation. Papillomas develop around the lips, gums or the side of the nose. Kore-Eda et al., (1995) reported a case where giant papillomas developed on the trunk and extremities. Scalp hair may be sparse or brittle and the nails are frequently dysplastic. The limb defects include syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4, polydactyly, or even missing fingers or part of a limb. The eyes are also frequently affected, mostly asymmetrically, with chorioretinal or iris colobomata, but unilateral anophthalmos has been reported. Lueder and Steiner (1995) reported a mother and daughter with subepithelial corneal opacities and prominent corneal nerves. They were said to have features of Goltz syndrome, but this was not well documented.  Microcephaly and retardation are frequent.
    Rodini et al., (1992) studied two probable cases without the typical skin lesions, but with signs of osteopathia striata. Irvine et al., (1996) reported a case with mediastinal dextropostion (presumably not true dextrocardia), intestinal malrotation, and duodenal atresia.
    Most cases are female and inheritance is thought to be X-linked dominant with early intrauterine lethality in males. There have been two reports of father to daughter transmission (Larregue et al., 1971; Burgdorf et al., 1981). The latter family was restudied by Gorski (1991), looking at X-inactivation, and it was concluded that the father was most likely to be a mosaic.
    Naritomi et al., (1992) reported two females with terminal Xp deletions. They had microphthalmia, cloudy corneae, mild linear skin lesions and agenesis of the corpus callosum. The authors felt that the clinical features overlapped with Aicardi and Goltz syndromes and suggested a contiguous gene syndrome.
    Zuffardi et al., (1989) a reported a girl with features of the condition who had a 9q32-qter deletion secondary to a maternal 4q35;9q32 translocation. She was found to have heterozygous deletion of COL5A1 and underexpression of alpha1 chains of type V collagen by fibroblasts (Ghiggeri et al., 1993). Bellosta et al., (1996) reported a family with 7 affected females. Cytogenetic analysis in two of these showed an apparent increase of structural chromosomal abnormalities in up to 5% of metaphases. Patel et al., (1997) reported a severely affected case detected by fetal ultrasound scans.</abstract>

    >    This syndrome is reminiscent of Larsen syndrome, in that there is joint laxity with multiple dislocations. The eyes are prominent, the nasal bridge tends to be flat, and there can be marked micrognathia. Radiological changes are distinctive. There are supernumerary phalanges, characteristically situated between the metacarpal and proximal phalanx of the index finger, osteoporosis, a short narrow thorax, metaphyseal enlargement and platyspondyly. Maroteaux et al., (1986) suggest that the prominence of the lesser trochanter at the hip is characteristic. Ossification in the carpal centres may be advanced, whereas the epiphyses of the long bones can have retarded development. Le Merrer et al., (1991) reported three cases - one typical and the other two with milder manifestations.
    Ogle et al., (1994) reported two cases with obstructive sleep apnoea. One case had a marked cervical kyphosis.
    Shohat et al., (1994) report seven cases and provide a good review. They point out the similarity of the hand changes to those seen in Catel-Manzke syndrome. Gillessen-Kaesbach et al., (1995) reported three further unrelated cases. Two had consanguineous parents.
    Nishimura et al., (1996) reported a 14-year-old boy with radiological features of the condition (monkey wrench proximal femur, osteopenia, advanced carpal ossification) but with normal birth length, no facial dysmorphism, no radial deviation of the second digits and mild joint laxity. Height at 4 years was -5SD.</abstract>

    >As the name implies, the manifestations of this condition are protean. It is characterised by massive overgrowth and asymmetry. The types of skin lesion include linear verrucous epidermal nevi, intradermal nevi, shagreen patches, haemangiomas, lipomas and varicosities. There may also be patchy dermal hypoplasia (Happle et al., 1997). Macrodactyly and syndactyly can occur (Sansom et al., 1993). Craniofacial anomalies include hydrocephalus, macrocephaly, facial and ocular asymmetry, retinal detachment, scleral tumours, prognathism, malocclusion and hyperostoses. There may be a characteristic warty, hyperplastic plantar overgrowth that has been termed a 'moccasin lesion'. Fryns (1995) suggests that cystic hygroma developing late in pregnancy may be an early manifestation of the condition. Hyperplasia or hypoplasia of the kidneys has been reported (Clark et al., 1987; Sato et al., (1995). Mental retardation may be present. Bouzas et al., (1993) summarised the ocular features of the condition including epibulbar dermoids, heterochromia of the iris, retinal and iris colobomata, glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataract, nystagmus and strabismus. Biesecker et al., (1999) outlined the diagnostic criteria and guidelines for patient evaluation. 
    Gordon et al., (1995) reported two patients, one with a probable mesothelioma involving the inferior surface of the diaphragm, and the other with serous cystadenomas of both ovaries. They reviewed other neoplasms reported in Proteus syndrome including meningiomas, optic nerve tumours, leiomyomas, and adenomas or adenocarcinomas of the testis. 
    There are similarities to linear sebaceous nevus, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber and Banayan-Zonana syndromes, as well as to neurofibromatosis. Tibbles and Cohen, (1986) suggested that the  \Elephant Man\ in fact had this condition, rather than neurofibromatosis.
    Goodship et al., (1991) reported a male infant with cranial hemihypertrophy, a lymphangioma over the lumbar region, a lipoma over the right thorax and a pigmented epidermal naevus over the neck. A CT scan showed hemimegalencephaly and partial schizencephaly. The father had a facial lymphangioma as a child. Autosomal dominant inheritance of Proteus syndrome was suggested, but it is not entirely certain that the father could be placed in this diagnostic category. Kruger et al., (1993) reported a similar mother and daughter. Say and Carpenter (1988) reported a 3-year-old girl with some features of the condition who had a duplication of 1q11-&lt;q25. Calzolari et al., (1996) reported a case of hemimegalencephaly with hypertrophy of the limbs, particularly on the right. There were overlapping features with Proteus syndrome.
    Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis may be a localised form of this condition (see McCall et al., (1992); Dean et al., (1990); Rizzo et al., (1993) and Ng et al., 1997) for cases with overlapping features). Cases with multiple hyperostoses of the calvaria, facial bones and mandible combined with epibulbar dermoids may also represent localised forms of the condition (Smeets et al., (1994) - see also Thanos (1977)). Haramato et al., (1995) reported a boy with a possible localised cranial form of the condition associated with asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres and irregular thickening of the meninges.  It is also not certain whether cases reported under the term macrodystrophia lipomatosa ('macrodactyly with lipofibromatosis') (Wu, 1991; Gorgan et al., 1991; Gupta et al., 1992) could have a localized form of this condition.
    Sarnat et al., (1993) reported in detail on muscle biopsies from an affected girl taken at 7 and 10 years of age. Cryoarchitectural alterations of myofibres, proliferation of sarcolemmal nuclei, and other myopathic changes were noted.  Sarnat (1994) suggests that this appearance is unlike that seen in any other known neuromuscular disease.
    It is worth noting the report indicating difficulties with wound healing following amputations  (Gates et al., 1996). There is a similar experience from Great Ormond Street hospital, London. (John Fixsen, personal communication, 1995).
    Rudolph et al., (1994) studied a 3-year-old girl with the condition and demonstrated reduced levels of IGF-I and IGF-II and their major growth hormone dependent binding protein IGFBP-3. The authors suggested that IGF production was generally disturbed.
    Biesecker et al., (1998) studied 18 patients with a possible diagnosis of Proteus syndrome. They found that MRI scanning of the abdomen was useful to demonstrate splenic hypoplasia and omental, mesenteric and extra-abdominal fatty overgrowth. A group of patients were identified with hemihyperplasia and multiple lipomas, where there did not seem to be a significant progression. It was hypothesised that this might be a separate group.
    Sigaudy et al., (1998) reported a possible case picked up by ultrasound examination at 17 weeks gestation. There was a mass in the right side of the abdomen diagnosed postnatally as a cystic lymphangioma. In addition there was macrodactyly of one toe, and enlargement of the left arm.
    Happle et al., (1999) reported a seven year old boy with partial fat atrophy and patchy dermal hypoplasia involving large areas of the body. He had minimal hemihyperplasia. There was a hyperostosis of the right external auditory meatus. It was postulated that cases with Proteus syndrome carry an abnormal allele leading to overgrowth ( a Pleioproteus allele), whereas in the reported case the majority of features were due to a negative allele (Elattoproteus allele). Manifestations of overgrowth were explained by double heterozygosity for a Pleioproteus allele with an Elattoproteus allele accompanied by somatic recombination giving homozygosity for either allele, similar to a twin -spot phenomenon. da Costa Oliveira et al., (1999) reported a male with some features of the condition who had developed precocious puberty at the age of eight years.

    >The facial features can be characteristic with macrocephaly, frontal and temporo-parietal bossing, and prominent supraorbital ridges. The jaw is prognathic, the nasal root is broad and there might be telecanthus or even true hypertelorism. The multiple nevoid basal cell carcinomas appear after puberty, especially on the face and neck, but also on the trunk and elsewhere. Ulceration is common. Other skin lesions include pits (punctate lesions) on the palmar and plantar areas, cysts and comedones (Baselga et al., 1996). Pivnick et al., (1996) reported a case with a midline nasal dermoid cyst. Bifid, fused, partially missing, or anteriorly splayed ribs occur in about 60% of cases. Kyphoscoliosis occurs in 30-40%. Spina bifida occulta occurs in about 60%. Short metacarpals, pre or postaxial polydactyly, syndactyly of the 2nd and 3rd fingers, and Sprengel deformity are also seen less commonly. Multiple cysts of the jaw develop during the first decade of life. These are odontogenic keratocysts. Eighty-five percent of cases will have developed these cysts by the age of 40 (Gorlin, 1987). Dural calcification, mild mental retardation, agenesis of the corpus callosum, medulloblastomas, ovarian fibromas, cardiac fibromas, lymphomesenteric cysts and hypogonadism (males have a female hair distribution) all occur (Evans et al., 1993). Ophthalmological abnormalities such as squint or cataract also occur, with colobomata and microphthalmia being rarer associations (Manners et al., 1996). Hogge et al., (1994) reported a fetus detected with macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly by fetal ultrasound. 
Farndon et al., (1992) and Reis et al., (1992) reported linkage to markers at 9q22-9q31. Gailani et al., (1992) and Bonifas et al., (1994) demonstrated loss of heterozygosity for 9q31 markers in basal cell carcinomas from individuals with this condition, and in isolated tumours. Levanat et al., (1996) reported a similar phenomenon in jaw cysts from patients.  
    Johnson et al., (1996) and Hahn et al., (1996) identified mutations in a gene coding for a transmembrane protein with homology to the Drosophila patched (ptc) gene product which acts in opposition to the Hedgehog signalling protein. Stone et al., (1996) presented evidence suggesting that patched is the receptor for sonic hedgehog. Gailani et al., (1996) found mutations in the ptc gene in a third of sporadic basal cell carcinomas by SSCP analysis. Petrikovsky et al., (1996) reported a case diagnosed prenatally both by DNA analysis and ultrasound. Wicking et al., (1997) found no genotype/phenotype correlation and showed that most mutations led to premature chain termination. Further mutations were reported by Lench et al., (1997).</abstract>

    >In this autosomal dominant condition exostoses of the long bones, pelvis and scapula occur bilaterally. They occur at the periphery of the epiphyseal growth plate and the metaphysis. Schmale et al., (1994) estimate the overall prevalence to be 1 in 50,000. The median age of diagnosis is 3 years, with a range from birth to 12 years (Schmale et al., 1994). The exostoses can cause deformities such as bowing of the forearms (Peterson, 1994), restriction of pronation and supination, tibia valga, obliquity of the distal tibial metaphysis and shortening of the fibula relative to the tibia. Buur and Morch (1983) reported a case with spinal cord compression and reviewed the literature on this complication. Dendale et al., (1995) reported a case with a haemothorax. Isolated subungual exostosis should not be confused with this condition (Davis and Cohen, 1996).
    Sarcomatous change may occur in 5-10% of cases according to some authors, although Peterson (1989) suggests that the real incidence of sarcomatous change might be nearer to 1%. Luckert Wicklund et al., (1995) found 2.8% of cases from a population of 180 had developed exostosis-related malignancy. Hennekam (1991) reports that the mean age of malignant degeneration is 31 years and that this complication seldom appears before the 10th or after the 50th years. Schmale et al., (1994) found only one case of chondrosarcoma amongst 113 affected individuals, however 76 of these individuals were less than 40 years old.
    Ogle et al., (1991) reported a case with a balanced 8;11 translocation with multiple exostoses (breakpoint at 8q24.11). Le Merrer et al., (1992) presented evidence suggesting that the gene does not map to 8q23-q24, despite the occurrence of multiple exostoses in Langer-Giedion syndrome (qv). However, Cook et al., (1993) found linkage to 8q24 markers in a subset of 11 families studied. They estimated that 70% of families with multiple exostoses are linked to 8q24.
    Wu et al., (1994) reported evidence for a second locus for multiple exostoses on 11p in two large families. McGaughran et al., (1995) described a patient with WAGR syndrome (qv) and multiple exostoses with an 11p11.2-p14.2 deletion. Wuyts et al., (1995) refined this localisation. Le Merrer et al., (1994) presented evidence for a third locus at 19p11-p13. 8q linked families are designated EXT1, 11p linked families are EXT2 and 19p families are EXT3. 
    Raskind et al., (1995) demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in chondrosarcomas for markers linked to the chromosome 8 and 11 forms of multiple exostoses in four out of eighteen tumours. Seventeen tumours were sporadic, but one came from a man with multiple exostoses, and loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 8 markers was demonstrated. Hecht et al., (1995) reported similar findings in familial multiple exostoses.
    Ahn et al., (1995) cloned a gene from the 8q24.1 region in EXT1 families and demonstrated frameshift mutations in two families linked to this region. There was no homology to other known gene sequences. Hecht et al., (1997) and Wells et al., (1997) reported further mutations in EXT1 cases. Stickens et al., (1996) and Wuyts et al., (1996) cloned the EXT2 gene. This shows striking sequence similarity to the EXT1 gene and a four base pair deletion was found in one familiy. Philippe et al., (1997) screened 17 families for mutations. Mutations were found in 12 (70%). Seven had mutations of EXT1 and five of EXT2. Wuyts et al., (1998) reported EXT1 and EXT2 mutations and reviewed the range of mutations up to that date. Raskind et al., (1998) studied 34 families from a Chamorro native background and found EXT1 mutations in twelve. From additional linkage studies they estimated that 45% of isolated and 77% of familial cases had EXT1 mutations. Xu et al., (1999) studied 36 Chinese families and found twelve mutations in the EXT2 gene and five mutations in the EXT1 gene.
    Rosbotham et al., (1994) reported a family where the condition appeared to cosegregate with psoriasis in four individuals in three generations. However a further individual had multiple exostoses only.
    Ishikawa-Brush et al., (1997)  reported a 27 year old female with autism and multiple exostoses who was found to have an Xt22.1;8q22.1 balanced translocation. The breakpoints on the X chromosome were found to be in intron1 of the GRPR gene, which codes for a G-protein-coupled receptor for gastrin-releasing peptide. On chromosome 8 the breakpoints were less than 30 kb distal to the 3' end of the SDC2 gene which codes for human heparan sulphate proteoglycan or fibroglycan.</abstract>

    >There are autosomal dominant and possibly autosomal recessive forms of this condition, not easily distinguished by clinical or radiological features (Wynne-Davies et al., 1985). Hall et al., (1987) suggest that some, if not all, of the apparently recessive cases are due to gonadal mosaicism in a parent. Ferguson et al., (1997) reported molecular evidence in two familes to support this suggestion.
    Short stature may not be noticed at birth, but may become apparent at 2-3 years. Adult height is usually between 90 and 145 cm. The craniofacial appearance is normal. The limbs are short and the joints lax; arthritis develops later. Abnormal spinal curvature is common, but seldom severe. Genu varum or valgum can be a problem. Radiographs reveal biconvex vertebral bodies in infancy, with an anterior tongue later on. In adult life the vertebrae can show platyspondyly, or be of normal height, but they have the normal rectangular shape. Long pedicles, irregular upper and lower sufaces and odontoid hypoplasia may be noted. A characteristic sign is slow development of the triradiate cartilage of the pelvis. Epiphyses are flat and delayed in development.
    Mansour (1988) reported three brothers with associated central areolar choroidal dystrophy. The pedigree was inbred.
    Briggs et al., (1993) and Hecht et al., (1993) mapped the gene to the pericentric region of chromosome 19 in dominant pedigrees. Hecht et al., (1995) and Briggs et al., (1995) found mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene in dominant families. COMP is a cartilage-specific protein expressed at high levels in the matrix of chondrocytes. Delot et al., (1999) reported trinucleotide expansion mutations in the COMP gene. This was a GAC repeat which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues in the calmodulin-like region of the protein. This was expanded to 6GAC in an MED pateint and 7GAC in a pseudoachondroplasia patient. About 1/3 of patients with pseudoachondroplasia have only 4GAC in this repeat. Mutations in the same gene have been found to cause some forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. In pseudoachondroplasia 40% of cases have deletions or duplications of the gene. Deere et al., (1998) and Ikegawa et al., (1998) reported further cases with mutations in the COMP gene. Ikegawa et al., (1998) reported a case with a de novo deletion of bands 11q21-q22.2. They suggested that this may define a second locus for the condition. A range mutations in pseudoachondroplasia-multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was reported by Briggs et al., (1998). A range of mutations on pseudoachondroplasia-multiple epiphyseal dysplasia was reported by Briggs et al., (1998) and Deere et al., (1999).

    >    This condition usually has an onset in childhood, but can occur later. The symptoms are mostly of muscle weakness in the lower limbs, fatigue, poor appetite, headache and pain in the limbs. Deafness due to juvenile otosclerosis has been reported (Huygen et al., 1996). There might be a waddling gait. On examination of the lower limbs the tibia feels thick and prominent and there might be muscle tenderness on palpation. In the upper limbs the radius may be similarly involved. Pathologically there is progressive bone formation along both the periosteal and endosteal surfaces of the long tubular bones. Radiologically there is sclerosis and thickening of the cortex of the skull and long bones, involving both the diaphyses and the metaphyses, but not the epiphyses. The spine is mostly spared. Occasionally there is severe scoliosis and a lumbar lordosis. Symptoms can be severe early on, but there is usually spontaneous remission.
    One patient presented with severe, progressive hearing loss and stapes fixation (Huygen et al., 1996). Hellier and Brookes (1996) reported a case with vestibular nerve dysfunction who benefited from a decompression procedure.</abstract>

    >    The autosomal dominant form of osteopetrosis is far less severe than the autosomal recessive form. Clinical problems include bone fragility, osteomyelitis, dental abscesses and mild anaemia. Occasionally the presenting feature is facial palsy or nerve deafness caused by cranial nerve compression. Radiographs reveal generalised osteosclerosis with a 'bone within bone' appearance and a 'rugger jersey' spine (an alternating pattern of sclerosis and normal bone in the vertebral bodies caused by sclerosis of the vertebral end-plates). Walpole et al., (1990) described an autosomal dominant family where expression varied from asymptomatic adults to a severely affected infant with anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, hydrocephalus and blindness. Wilms et al., (1990) reported a case with cerebrovascular occlusive disease.
    Andersen and Bollerslev (1987) suggested there were two types of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, distinguished by the radiographic features. In type I there is marked sclerosis of the cranial vault and increased density of the vertebral arches, whereas in type II the sclerosis of the skull is limited to the base and there is sclerosis of the vertebral bodies in a typical \rugger-jersey\ pattern. There is evidence that type II cases have a high risk of fracture, whereas type I cases do not (Bollerslev and Andersen, 1989; El-Tawil and Stoker, 1993). Yoneyama et al., (1992) reported elevated levels of the BB isoenzyme of serum creatine kinase in type II cases.
    Johnson et al., (1997) mapped the gene in a family segregating for 'high bone mass' to 11q12-13. It is not clear what relation the phenotype had to osteopetrosis. Van Hul et al., (1997) mapped the gene for autosomal dominant osteopetrosis to 1p21 in a large Danish pedigree.</abstract>

    >The primary defect is a deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine synthetase, and the main problems concern connective tissue and a tendency to thrombose vessels. The course is variable and often unpredictable. Lens dislocation is rarely present before 3 years, and the direction is often downwards. There may be glaucoma, cataracts, myopia and retinal detachment. Bones are osteoporotic, and deformities of the chest wall, and valgus deformities at the knees or ankles are frequent. Patients are usually tall and thin (not always), but do not have arachnodactyly. A malar flush should be looked for, and fair skin and hair might be part of the clinical picture. Most thrombotic episodes are cerebrovascular, but thromboses of the lungs and kidneys are not uncommon. Whereas mental retardation can occur, this is not always the case. An alanine load might be diagnostically necessary.
    Mutations have been found at the locus coding for cystathionine beta-synthase on chromosome 21q22.3 (Marble et al., 1994; Dawson et al., 1997; Kluijtmans et al., 1999). There are 2 relatively common mutations 1278T, and G307S, the former accounting for 15% and the latter 58% (Sebastio et al., 1995). To date 16 different mutations have been identified (Kluijtmans et al., 1995). Kraus (1994) reviews the molecular basis of the condition.

    >    The progressive ossification which characterises this condition can occur at any time from birth to 10 years, with a mean age of onset of 3 years. Typically there is an initial subcutaneous lump, sometimes provoked by trauma, followed four-six months later by radiological evidence of ossification. The main sites for these lesions are over the spine, the shoulder joints and jaw (but also elsewhere, causing restriction of movement and respiratory problems). Shah et al., (1994) review the spinal manifestations of the condition. The other important clue to the diagnosis is the presence of a small big-toe. In most cases there is an absent skin crease, a single phalanx and deviation of the toe laterally. In a small proportion of patients the big-toe is of normal length, but is stiff in childhood leading, with age, to bony fusion. The thumbs can be similarly affected. Baldness and deafness are occasional features. Synovial osteochondromatosis may also be a feature (Herman, 1994). 
    Connor et al., (1993) reported a family where individuals in three generations were affected. They reviewed the evidence for autosomal dominant inheritance which includes concordant monozygotic twins, a paternal age effect for presumed new mutations, and several instances of parent to child transmission, including male to male transmission. Kaplan et al., (1993) also reported an apparently dominant pedigree.  Janoff et al., (1996) reported two affected half-sisters.  Their mother was normal, suggesting gonadal mosaicism.
    Kaplan et al., (1990) suggested, from homology with the decapentaplegic (dpp) locus of Drosophila, which is caused by an abnormality of a gene in the TGF-beta family, that bone morphogenetic proteins 2A and 2B may be involved in human FOP.
    Bruni et al., (1990) review the use of ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate (EHDP) in this condition. Bar Oz and Boneh (1994) report a case treated for 10 years on this regime. There was gradual progression of the disease but no typical bouts of swelling, reddening or hardening of areas over skeletal muscle, which is usually seen in untreated cases.  Buyse et al., (1996) provide a good review and discuss the treatment strategies and possible role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in this condition.
    Shafritz et al., (1996) studied lymphoblastoid and fibroblast lines from affected individuals. They found overexpression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 in lymphocytes of affected individuals.</abstract>

    >    Cases have been reported with clinical features transitional between Mohr syndrome (OFD II) and Majewski syndrome (short rib-polydactyly II). Affected individuals have a midline cleft or notch of the upper lip, multiple oral frenula, fleshy nodules or hamartomas of the tongue, and a high or cleft palate. In the hands post-axial polydactyly is common and in the feet pre- and post-axial polydactyly can be seen. The tibia is severely hypoplastic, but does not have the ovoid shape seen in Majewski syndrome. Anal atresia has been reported (Meinecke and Hayek, 1990; Digilio et al., 1995). The ribs are relatively normal, allowing survival, but in some cases rib shortening can be demonstrated. Congenital heart defects have been reported including a single atrium, VSD, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, and tetralogy of Fallot (reviewed by Digilio et al., 1995). Some cases have cerebral abnormalities including Dandy-Walker malformation (Gillerot, 1988), or cerebral atrophy and micropolygyria (Burn et al., 1984; Digilio et al., 1995).
    Ades et al., (1994) reported a 27-week fetus with features of the condition, but with more severe internal abnormalities. There were midline clefts of the epiglottis and tongue with the larynx appearing to be a solid mass of cartilage with a lumen only shown histologically. The lungs were hypoplastic and there was a lobulated serous cyst anteroinferior to the liver. The small and large bowel was malrotated and there was a large lobulated intrahepatic cyst and enlarged cystic kidneys. Periportal hepatic fibrosis was demonstrated. The olfactory bulbs were absent and there appeared to be neuronal migration defects in the brain.
    Majewski et al., (1996) reported a case with overlapping features of Jeune and Mohr syndromes. 
    Toriello et al., (1997) reported six cases and provides a good review. </abstract>

    >This is a rare, lethal, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia in which the neck is short and the chest is narrow. The eyes are protuberant with a slight downward slant and the nose has a flat root and anteverted nostrils. A cleft palate was present in both of the unrelated infants reported by Whitley et al., (1984). Radiologically, the long bones are short and very broad with slightly irregular metaphyses and peripheral spur formation. There maybe extra-articular calcification, giving the appearence of stippling. The iliac bones are small and inferiorly broad and the lower margins have a caudally directed bump-like configuration bordered by spurs. The sacrosciatic notches are small. The vertebral bodies are flat and least ossified in the cervical area. A sagittal midline cleft is present in most of the vertebral bodies. The ribs are short and cupped at their anterior ends.  Al-Gazali et al., (1997) report a Omani child with the condition and provide a good review. Hunt and Vujanic (1998) reported a 17 week fetus with the condition who also had severe micrognathia and a bifid tongue. </abstract>

    >The oral features of this condition are a midline cleft or notch of the upper lip, multiple hyperplastic oral frenula, asymmetrical cleft palate, clefting of the maxillary alveolar ridge into an anterior portion containing the canine teeth and two posterior segments, and a lobulated tongue with hamartomata. The facial features are prominent milia in infancy, a broad nasal root, dystopia canthorum, hypoplasia of the alar cartilages and narrow nares. The digital features are brachydactyly and skin syndactyly of the hands, clinodactyly, polydactyly of the hallux, and brachydactyly of the toes. Al-Qattan (1998) reported a case with cone-shaped epiphyses of the phalanges of the toes. Other abnormalities include polycystic kidneys, partial alopecia and CNS abnormalities leading to mental retardation (these include hydrocephaly, porencephaly, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, Dandy-Walker cysts, neuronal migration defects and agenesis of the corpus callosum) - these are reviewed by Odent et al., (1998). Orstavik et al., (1992) reported a case with pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Somer et al., (1986) reported a case with precocious puberty, thought to be secondary to a hypothalamic hamartoma.
    The gene is lethal in males, who are thought to die in utero, although occasional, severely affected, near term cases are reported (Goodship et al., 1991; Gillerot et al., 1993). 
    Toriello (1988) considers the mother and daughter reported by Whelan et al., (1975) with  a midline cleft of the upper lip, a bifid tongue, alar hypoplasia and hydronephrosis, but with only clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, to represent a distinct OFD syndrome, but the variability in OFD type I is probably enough to encompass these cases.
    Orstavik et al., (1992) reported a case with a pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Note that this abnormality can also occur in OFD type II. Feather et al., (1997) mapped the gene to Xp22.2-Xp22.3.</abstract>

    >Severe short stature is present from birth and the face is usually flat with the head disproportionately large. The eyes might be prominent and there is often a cleft palate. Many infants will have respiratory problems in the neonatal period. There is certainly a lethal neonatal form that may represent the severe end of the clinical spectrum (Spranger and Maroteaux, 1991). Scoliosis is a frequent complication and the joints are often stiff and prominent. Other problems include myopia, which might lead to a detached retina, and sensorineural deafness. Diagnosis must be confirmed radiologically. Radiographs show broad metaphyses and irregular epiphyses especially around the knees. There is platyspondyly and coronal clefts of the vertebrae and there is an additional ossification centre at the distal end of the middle phalanx. Histologically there is a characteristc 'Swiss-cheese' appearance of the cartilage.
    Mawn et al., (1990) reported a possible case with congenital glaucoma. Maumenee et al., (1985) reviewed the ocular features of the condition.
    Winterpacht et al., (1993) reported a 2-year-old with the condition who was shown to have a 28 basepair deletion of the COL2A1 gene. Her mother had the Stickler phenotype and was found to be mosaic for this mutation. Bogaert et al., (1994) and Winterpacht et al., (1996) reported individuals with deletions of the COL2A1 gene. Winterpacht et al., (1994) reported a further case of Kniest syndrome with a COL2A1 mutation affecting a splice site in intron 20. The father had a mild form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita with premature osteoarthrosis and evidence was provided that he was a mosaic for the mutation. Spanger et al., (1994) reported this case again together with other cases of Kniest syndrome with a similar mutation. Wilkin et al., (1994) reported a case with an amino acid substitution in the COL2A1 gene.
    Spranger et al., (1997) reported the COL2A1 mutation in the original patient of Dr Kniest. This destroyed a splice site. Wilkin et al., (1999) emphasise that the most common mutation is an in-frame deletion in the COL2A1 gene usually located between exons 12 and 24. Splice donor sites mutations usually results in exon skipping. The authors concluded that Kniest dysplasia results from a shorter type II collagen protein.</abstract>

    >This condition was described in a sibship by Al-Awadi (1985) and more completely in a second Middle Eastern, consanguineous family by Raas-Rothschild et al., (1988). The disorder differs from FFU by virtue of its occurrence in sibs, and because of the more severe limb defects. The malformations consist of hypoplasia of the proximal part of, or marked angulation and hypoplasia of the femur, absence of the fibula and a malformed (usually hypoplastic) ulna. Multiple digits may be absent to give a split hand appearance or monodactyly. Both lower limbs are usually involved and may have the appearance of small stick-like projections with very hypoplastic or absent feet. The thorax is barrel shaped and the pelvis markedly malformed. One case, diagnosed prenatally, had an occipital meningocele and a hypoplastic cerebellum. 
    The case report by Walbaum et al., (1982) and the condition reported by Fuhrmann et al., (1980) (qv) may be the same. Camera et al., (1993), Farag et al., (1993) and Genuardi et al., (1997) reported further cases. Mollica et al., (1995) reported a further possible case. There was, in addition, a cleft lip and palate and exstrophy of the bladder.
    Kumar et al., (1997) reported 4 children from an inbred consanguineous Muslim family from the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan with what was probably the same condition. Absence of some nails was a striking feature in this family.  </abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Conductive deafness in this syndrome is caused by abnormalities of the auditory ossicles. The palate is cleft and the face is characteristic with hypertelorism, prominent supra-orbital ridges, poorly modelled pinnae, a broad nasal bridge with a small nose and mouth, and an antimongoloid eyeslant. The overall impression is said to be of 'pugilistic' facies and this may become more marked with age. The ends of the thumbs, halluces and sometimes the other digits are flattened and skin syndactyly, clinodactyly and short square nails are usually seen. The appearance in the feet is particularly characteristic with a large gap between the 1st and 2nd toes, a short hallux and lateral curvature of the  toes. Radiographs of the hands show cone-shaped epiphyses and a characteristic pattern of shortening of the bones. Females may show mild manifestations. Suzumura et al., (1998) reported a case with hypoplasia of the transverse sinus of the brain and enlarged occipital sinuses. The gene maps to Xq28 (Biancalana et al., (1991).
    Note that the case reported by Superti-Furga et al., (1987) has also been reported by Danks et al., (1972) as a case of fronto-metaphyseal dysplasia. There is considerable overlap between these two conditions. There is also overlap with OPD type II - Horn et al., (1995) report brothers demonstrating this phenomenon.</abstract>

    >This form of acrocephalosyndactyly was well reviewed by Pantke et al., (1975). It is characterised by asymmetric facies, brachycephaly, parietal foramina, a broad forehead, ptosis, a beaked nose, loss of the frontonasal angle, low-set ears with folded pinnae and prominent cruri, and minor abnormalities of the hands and feet. The latter consist of soft tissue syndactyly, mild brachydactyly, clinodactyly and hallux valgus.
    The hallux can be quite broad but is not in varus as seen in Pfeiffer syndrome. Some cases are mistakenly reported as Pfeiffer syndrome because of the broad halluces (see Naveh and Friedman, (1976) for example). 
    Mild mental retardation may be present and craniostenosis can be demonstrated in about 90% of patients. 
    Cases with 7p21 deletions have many similarities including craniosynostosis and parietal foramina (see Motegi et al., (1985), Kikkawa et al., (1993) and Chotai et al., (1994) for good reviews). The case reported by Grebe et al., (1992) with a 7p15.3-p21.2 or 7p21.3 deletion had many similarities. Note that there may be a gene more proximal to 7p21 that also causes craniosynostosis (Aughton et al., 1991). This gene is probably distinct from the Greig syndrome gene at 7p13. Van Allen et al., (1992) discuss the evidence for a 'craniosynostosis gene' on 15q. They point out that in the mouse there are contiguous homologous regions to human 7p and 15q on mouse chromosome 2, suggesting an cluster of genes important in suture formation in the mouse that have become separated in the human. There may be another gene for coronal craniosynostosis on 8q (Fryburg and Golden, 1993).
    Brueton et al., (1992) found evidence of linkage to markers around 7p21 in Saethre-Chotzen families. Refined localisation was reported by Lewanda et al., (1994) and van Herwerden et al., (1994). Reardon et al., (1993) identified a de novo translocation case with breakpoints at 7p21.2; Reid et al., (1993) similarly identified a translocation case with breakpoints at 7p22. Tsuji et al., (1994) reported a further case with an apparently balanced 6;7 translocation. The breakpoints on 7 were reported as 7p15.3. The explanation for the discrepancy between these breakpoints is not clear. Ma et al., (1996) carried out further linkage studies and discussed the evidence for possibly two loci on 7p. Rose et al., (1994) carried out FISH studies using YACs from the 7p21 region in four translocation cases, including that of Reardon et al., (1993). Wilkie et al., (1995) described the clinical features of the cases in the paper of Rose et al., (1994) in detail. 
    Von Gernet et al., (1996) reported a four generation family where at least seven individuals have convincing features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, but the locus does not appear to map to 7p.
    Howard et al., (1997) and El Ghouzzi et al., (1997) described mutations in the TWIST gene, which codes for a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Nonsense, missense, insertion and deletion mutations were described. Krebs et al., (1997) showed a breakpoint in a translocation case first reported by Tsuji et al., (1984) mapping 5 kb 3 ' from TWIST, suggesting a positional effect. Further mutations were reported by El Ghouzzi et al., (1999). Further mutations in the TWIST gene were reported by Rose et al., (1997), including 3 cases with a 21bp duplication. Four translocation cases were also examined, and the breakpoints were at least 5kb from TWIST, suggesting a positional effect. Gripp et al., (1999) reported a case with a stop mutation in TWIST where there was radial aplasia.
    Johnson et al., (1998) studied ten patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and found mutations in eight. They also found mutations in two patients out of 43 cases with no clear diagnostic label. Of the ten mutations, four represented significant deletions, one in a 7;8 balanced translocation case. Two other cases had a large deletion (3.5-10.2Mb) and were associated with developmental delay.
    Paznekas et al., (1998) studied 32 cases with a Saethre-Chotzen phenotype and found TWIST mutations in twelve. A Pro250RJRG mutation of the FGFR3 gene was found in seven cases and a 6-bp inframe deletion of the IgII, IgIII linker region of the FGFR2 gene was found in one family.</abstract>

    >The ectodermal part of this syndrome involves the hair, teeth and nails. Hypohidrosis is variable, although the skin is often dry and hyperkeratosis of palms and feet might occur. The hair is sparse, fair and dry and the eyebrows and lashes are often absent. The teeth are small and may be partially formed, and hypodontia and anodontia occur. The nails are thin, brittle and ridged, and tear duct abnormalities are common. Buss et al., (1995) provide a good review of 24 cases and Roelfsema and Cobben (1996) review 230 cases from the literature.  Arbesfeld et al., (1993) reported a case with multiple cutaneous telangiectasias. Trueb et al., (1997)  report a case with scarring folliculitis. Retinal detachment has been reported in two cases (McNab et al., 1989; Wald et al., 1993). De Smet and Fryns (1995) reported a case with anal atresia and an umbilical hernia. Frick et al., (1997) reported a case with a hypoplastic thymus and T-cell deficiency. 
    Lacombe et al., (1993) reported a female who was thought to have some features of LADD syndrome (qv), but where the mother had classical split hands and feet. She had no skin or hair abnormalities or oral clefting. In view of the variability of EEC syndrome, it seems most likely that this was the diagnosis in the family. 
    Nardi et al., (1992) found urogenital anomalies in 13 out of 25 cases. Abnormalities included megaureter, vesicoureteric reflux, hydronephrosis and hypospadias. Maas et al., (1996) provide an extensive review of urogenital abnormalities in this condition. Majewski and Goecke (1996) reported a case with anal atresia.
    Mental development is usually normal and facial clefting, mostly in the form of a cleft lip and palate, is a common, but not essential part of the syndrome. Indeed, all the features are very variable and extreme care must be taken in examining and counselling parents of an apparently isolated case. Moerman and Fryns (1996) reported a severely affected case whose mother did not have limb defects and had been diagnosed as having Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. It is of interest that the child had eyelid synechiae.
    Knudtzon and Aarskog (1987) reported a case with growth hormone deficiency and Van Maldergem et al., (1992) and Kuna et al., (1994) cases with vasopressin and gonadotropin deficiency. The latter authors suggested a general abnormality of hypothalamic-pituitary function. Gershoni-Baruch et al., (1997) reported two further brothers with hypothalamo-pituitary insufficiency.
    It is not certain that the cases reported by Hasegawa et al., (1991) had the EEC syndrome, but if they did it suggests the locus is at 7q11-21, around the same breakpoints associated with isolated cleft hand. Fukushima et al., (1993) located the breakpoints in the Hasegawa et al., (1991) family to 7q11.2 and 9p12 by FISH. Qumsiyeh (1992) reported a further case with a breakpoint at 7q21.3. Akita et al., (1993) reported a case with a paracentric inversion (7)(q22.1;q36.3).</abstract>

    >Also referred to as the trapezoidocephaly-multiple synostosis (TSM) syndrome the outstanding features are premature closure of the coronal and lambdoidal sutures, proptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, severe depression of the nasal bridge (with or without choanal stenosis or atresia), and apparently low set and protruding ears. There is brachycephaly with frontal bossing. In the limbs the main features are radio-humeral synostosis, medial bowing of the ulnae, bowing of the femora, slender hands and feet, contractures at the proximal IP joints, fractures and advanced bone age (Schinzel et al., 1983). Some patients have congenital heart disease, renal anomalies and abnormalities of the female genitalia. The other radiological features are the presence of thin ribs and a narrow pelvis. Antich et al., (1993) reported a possible case with anal atresia, a horseshoe kidney, and periventricular leukomalacia. Feigin et al., (1995) reported a case with oesophageal atresia, however the child also had trisomy 21. LeHeup et al., (1995) reported a case with bilateral renal agenesis. Hassell and Butler (1994) report a further case and provide a good review of the literature. 
    Some cases of Pfeiffer syndrome can have elbow synostosis and may be confused with Antley-Bixler syndrome.  See for example the cases reported by Kitoh et al., (1996). Crisponi et al., (1997) report a possible case with radio-ulnar synostosis rather than radio-humeral, a provide a good review.
    Most cases are sporadic but Schinzel et al., (1983) reported affected sisters and LeHeup et al., (1995) an affected brother and sister. Yasui et al., (1983), Susuki et al., (1987) and Feigin et al., (1995) reported cases with consanguineous parents. Bottero et al., (1997) report two cases and provide a good review. Aleck and Bartley (1997) reviewed cases where infants had been exposed to in utero fluconazole. They had similarities to Antley-Bixler syndrome. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, suggesting an abnormality in sterol metabolism in Antley-Bixler syndrome.
    Chun et al., (1998) reported a case with some features of the condition with an FGFR2 mutation (Ser351Cys). This child also had spinal dysraphism, sagittal clefts at  T11, L2, L3, and L4 and intersegmental fusion of the thoracic spine. However, note that Gorlin (1999) and Gripp et al., (1999) feel that this child did not have Antley-Bixler syndrome. The case reported by Chabchoub et al., (1998) as a case of Antley-Bicler appears to fall into the same catergory as cases reported by Ades et al., (1995) (see Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome)</abstract>

There was non-specific brachydactyly with \pseudoclubbing\ and broad short fingernails. The most characteristic features were seen on radiographs of the hands. The bone age was markedly delayed and there were abnormal phalanges with variable shortening and the appearance of a \Christmas tree angel\. There were severe abnormalities of the femoral head leading to Perthes disease. Scheuermann-like features were seen in the spine. Mother-to-child transmission was seen in two pedigrees.</abstract>

    >Patients with this well known syndrome have a combination of dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, pectus deformities of the chest, mitral or aortic regurgitation, ectopia lentis and mild joint laxity. Other evidence of a generalised connective tissue disorder may be present such as scoliosis and skin striae. A dilated aortic root can usually be demonstrated by echocardiography and aortic aneurysms can ensue. Thomas et al., (1996) conclude that the metacarpal index is not a good diagnostic test. De Paepe et al., (1996) discuss the diagnositc criteria.  Average life expectancy is halved. 95% of deaths are due to a cardiovascular cause. Shores et al., (1994) studied the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade and concluded that this slowed the rate of aortic dilatation and reduced the development of complications from aortic rupture in some patients with Marfan syndrome. Gray et al., (1998) studied life expectancy in British patients. Mean age of death was 45.3 years. 50% median cumulative survival was 53 years for males and 72 years for females. There have been about 10 case reports (van den Berg et al., 1996) of cerebral aneurysms in Marfan syndrome, but the association is doubted by some (van den Berg et al., 1996). The Committee on Genetics of the American Academy of Pediatrics provide guidelines for management during childhood (Desposito et al., 1996). Lipscomb et al., (1997) report the experience of 36 women who had 91 pregnancies. 4 had an aortic dissection relating to the pregnancy and two others required aortic surgery following delivery. The incidence of  obstetric complications did not exceed expectation.
    The condition has been shown to be caused by mutations of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) on chromosome 15 (see Tsipouras et al., (1992) for review). Gray et al., (1994) estimated a prevalence of 1 in 14,000 in Scotland. Twenty-seven percent of cases appeared to be new mutations. Most mutations are unique to individual families. Hayward et al., (1997) screened all 65 exons of the gene and found mutations in 78% of well characterised familial cases but only about 20% of sporadic cases. Intragenic markers can be used for predictive testing (Rantamaki et al., 1994; Pereira et al., 1994), however care must be taken because of possible genetic heterogeneity (for example see Boileau et al., 1993). Diagnosis by assessment of fibrillin immunofluorescence on skin biopsies or fibroblast cultures is still technically difficult and the accuracy is not certain (Schaefer and Godfrey, 1995). Rantamaki et al., (1999) provided evidence for parental germ-line mosaicism in a family. Dietz and Pyeritz (1995) provide a good review of mutations in the fibrillin gene in Marfan syndrome. Liu et al., (1996) reviewed cases with exon-skipping mutations of the FBN1 gene resulting in a fibrillin-1 chain lacking EGF-like domains. Lui et al., (1997) reported a further exon skipping mutation. Many of these cases have the severe neonatal form of the disorder and a dominant negative effect was postulated. Putnam et al., (1996) present data suggesting that cases with mutations in exons 25-27 of the FBN1 gene have relatively severe cardiac manifestations or the neonatal form. Collod-Beroud et al., (1997) has published a database of mutations in the FBN1 gene in Marfan syndrome. Liu et al., (1998) reported a 76% detection rate for mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
    Kilpatrick et al., (1996) reported preimplantation diagnosis of Marfan syndrome using linked markers.</abstract>

    >This condition is very similar to the condition known as Moore-Federman dwarfism, and the main diagnostic features are short stature, which is noted after the age of 2 years, and striking 'stockiness' of the hands and feet. The facial features are subtle, but the palpebral fissures are narrow, the cheeks are full and the nose is stubby with anteverted nostrils. Radiologically the metacarpals are short (especially 2-5), there are cone-shaped epiphyses and a delay in bone maturation. The first and second phalanges are short and broad. Histology of the cartilage shows a disorganization of the growth zone with islands of cells (some degenerated) and abnormal organization of collagen. There is an accumulation of glycogen in most chondrocytes.
    No further cases have been described, however there is marked similarity to acromicric dysplasia, which may be the same condition (Winter et al., 1989) and Moore-Federmann syndrome.  Hennekam et al., (1996) also discussed the differential diagnosis between acromicric dysplasia, Moore-Federmann syndrome, and geleophysic dysplasia.</abstract>

    >In brachydactyly type C fingers 2 and 3 are obviously short and the 4th finger is the longest in the hand. Perthe's hip dysplasia and proportional short stature can be associated (Fitch et al., 1979). Radiologically the middle phalanges of fingers 2 and 3 are short and there might be an extra, wedge-shaped proximal phalanx, or a radial projection at the base of the phalanx which seems to be due to a fusion with an extra phalanx. Clinodactyly of the 5th finger is common. The proximal phalanges of fingers 2 and 3 might also be short, as well as the metacarpal of finger 3. The thumb might have a short metacarpal. Rowe-Jones et al., (1992) reported a family where affected individuals had cup-shaped ears and short halluces. Camera et al., (1994) reported a case where the mother was thought to be affected, and metacarpophalangeal profile demonstrated this quite convincingly.
    Stagiannis et al., (1995) reported a fetus picked up with exencephaly where the mother had brachydactyly type C with a three generation pedigree history of the condition.
    In mice where the Hoxd-13 gene has been deleted somewhat similar limb abnormalities occur, although a postaxial postminimus also appears to be present. 
    Polymeropoulos et al., (1996) mapped the gene to 12q24 in the family originally reported by Haws (1963). Polinkovsky et al., (1997) reported mutations in the CDMP1 gene on chromosome 20 in six families. These were mainly predicted to cause haploinsufficiency. CDMP1 mutations also cause mesomelia type Hunter-Thompson and Grebe syndrome (qv).</abstract>

    >    This form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is milder than the congenita type and is X-linked. Presentation is between 5 and 10 years with back or hip pain. Characteristically the vertebrae show a posterior hump of bone on their superior and inferior aspects when viewed laterally. Mild epiphyseal dysplasia is seen in the hips and shoulders, but rarely in other joints. Occasionally, patients presenting with similar features have been reported in autosomal dominant or recessive pedigrees, although the vertebral bodies may not show the hump of bone.
    The gene has been localised to Xp22 (Szpiro-Tapia et al., 1988; Heuertz et al., 1993; Heuertz et al., 1995). MacKenzie et al., (1996) studied a large kindred, confirming linkage to Xp22 and providing a good clinical review of the condition.</abstract>

    >Achondroplasia should be diagnosed at birth. Clinically the rhizomelic limb shortening and the broad and prominent forehead might not be striking, but radiologically the pelvis is clearly abnormal. The iliac wings are small and square and the acetabular roof is horizontal with narrowing of the greater sciatic notch. Projecting medially from the roof there is a bony spike. The long bones are short and the metaphyses slope, resulting in a translucent area at the proximal ends of the femora in the neonatal period. The narrowing of the interpedicular distances becomes evident later. Neurologically, a significant number of cases develop pyramidal signs in their lower limbs, because of an abnormal foramen magnum, resulting in either compression or hydrocephalus. Pauli et al., (1995) found evidence of significant cervicomedullary junction compression in 10% of cases. They suggested that the best predictors for this complication were lower limb hyperreflexia or clonus, central hypopnoea demonstrated by polysonography, and evidence of significant narrowing of the foramen magnum on scanning. Spinal cord stenosis might be an additional problem. Rimoin (1995) suggested that many of the neurological problems secondary to apparent cervicomedullary junction compression in achondroplasia resolve spontaneously with age. He suggested that lack of CSF flow both anteriorly and posteriorly, and intracord lesions as indicated by abnormal cord signal on T2-weighted imaging, are the two features best indicating the need for surgery. Sleep apnoea and upper airways obstruction may be a problem (Zucconi et al., 1996; Tasker et al., 1998). Stamoyannou et al., (1997) report preliminary results of treatment with growth hormone. Hunter et al., (1998) review the medical complications of the condition.
    Prenatal diagnosis with ultrasonography may be difficult.  Modaff et al., (1996) found that cases with a previous family history were diagnosed successfully but that only 57% of sporadic cases were found to have abnormal ultrasound features. A combined molecular and ultrasound approach is now more reliable (Mesoraca et al., 1996). Bellus et al., (1994) reported prenatal diagnosis by DNA analysis in a pregnancy where both parents had achondroplasia. The fetus was predicted to be a heterozygote.
    Verloes et al., (1991) reported a case with a neuroblastoma and suggested localization of the gene to 1p32-p36.
    Velinov et al., (1994), Le Merrer et al., (1994) and Francomano et al., (1994) reported linkage to 4p16.3. Shiang et al., (1994) and Rousseau et al., (1994) reported mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene in individuals with achondroplasia. In the Shiang et al., (1994) paper, fifteen out of sixteen cases had a G-&lt;A transition at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA leading to the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine at position 380 of the mature protein. Bellus et al., (1995) studied 154 unrelated individuals and found that 150 had the G-&lt;A transition at position 1138 and 3 had a G-&lt;C transversion at the same position. One case was not found to have a mutation, but was thought to be atypical clinically. Wilkin et al., (1998) showed that 40 out of 40 sporadic cases received a paternally inherited mutation in the FGFR3 gene.
    Superti-Furga (1995) reported a case with a glycine to cysteine substitution at position 375 in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. From the published radiographs the skeletal features were relatively severe with platyspondyly and quite severe rib shortening. Nishimura et al., (1995) report a mother and child with the same mutation. They pointed out that marked flattening of the vertebral bodies and metaphyseal dysplasia seem to be associated with this mutation. See also the comments by Nishimura and Takada (1997).
    Naski et al., (1996) showed that mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause a gradient of ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation in thanatophoric dysplasia, achondrogenesis and hypochondroplasia. Webster and Donoghue (1996) also demonstrated constitutive activation of the FGFR3 receptor bearing the Arg380-&lt;Gly mutation.  It should be noted that FGFR3 haploinsufficiency in the mouse results in elongation of the long bones. Nguyen et al., (1997) studied calcium signaling in fibroblasts from cases with homozygous achondroplasia, heterozygous achondroplasia, TD1and TD2, and concluded that mutant FGFR3 can function in a dosage dependent dominant-negative fashion to inactivate FGFR signaling. Huggins et al., (1999) report the clinical features of a molecularly proven achondroplasia-hypochondroplasia double heterozgote. There was a narrow chest with respiratory distress requiring home oxygen at the age of 8 months. A further case was reported by Chitayat et al., (1999). There were similar respiratory problems together with seizures. Brain CT scans showed possible grey matter heterotopia with partial agenesis of the corpus collasum and cortical dysplasia.</abstract>

    >    This is a form of dyssegmental dwarfism that is not as severe as the Silverman type (q.v.). The trunk is longer than in the latter type and the limbs are less deformed. The face shows micrognathia and cleft palate. The hallmark of these conditions is platyspondyly with malsegmentation and anisospondyly. In other words the vertebrae vary considerably in size and shape and each vertebral body may contain two or more ossification centres of different sizes. Coronal clefts are also seen. The long bones are short and slightly bowed and the metaphyses are expanded. The ilia are hypoplastic and the acetabulae have a lateral spur. Histopathology reveals 'Swiss cheese-like' cystic changes in the cartilage growth plates, which may be identical to those seen in Kniest dysplasia. 
    Maroteaux et al., (1996) reported two cases with some features of dyssegmental dysplasia type II associated with glaucoma and iridocorneal dysgenesis.  The radiological appearance of the lower limbs suggested Kniest dysplasia but the vertebral abnormalities were more like dyssegmental dysplasia.  COL2A1 mutations were not detected. </abstract>

    >Fourteen patients were described by Anderson et al., (1982) with an apparently autosomal recessive condition resembling spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita in the first 3-5 years of life, but with additional changes later on. Later there is expansion and 'dappling' of the metaphyses with alternating patterns of osteosclerosis and radiolucent areas, starting in the proximal femurs, but affecting other metaphyses by the age of 5-6 years. The series of Anderson et al., (1982) includes an affected brother and sister, born to non-consanguineous parents. The authors suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, although parental mosaicism for a dominant mutation could also be a possibility. Spranger and Maroteaux (1983) questioned whether the condition is separate from spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, but in later classifications it seems to be recognised as a separate entity. Murray et al., (1989) demonstrated a type II collagen defect in one case. Tiller et al., (1995) reported dominant mutations in COL2A1 in three unrelated cases. Vikkula et al., (1993) also reported a Gly154Arg mutation in type II collagen in a 16-year-old boy with features of a form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. Kaitila et al., (1996) provided further details of this patient and a 26-year-old female with the same mutation. Nakamura et al., (1999) reported a 16 year old girl with a form of spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with normal stature.  </abstract>

    >There is usually shortening of phalanges and other elements of the digits in association with cutaneous syndactyly. The hand abnormality is usually seen unilaterally in association with ipsilateral absence of one or more portions of the pectoralis major (usually the sternal head). This combination is given the eponym Poland syndrome. Ipsilateral rib defects and absence of the breast or nipple may also occur. The middle phalanges are relatively more severely affected and distal symphalangism can occur, giving the appearance of hypophalangia. The thumb is least severely affected.  Abnormal dermatogolyphics may also been seen (David and Saad 1974). Riccardi (1978), Corona-Rivera (1997) and Silengo et al., (1999) reported cases with an analogous defect of one lower limb. This consisted of gluteal hypoplasia and ipsilateral brachysyndactyly of the toes. David and Saad (1974) suggest that in the abscence of syndactyly the diagnosis can be supported by dermatoglyphic analysis. They reported a case where there was no syndactyly, but a short hand. Dermatoglyphic analysis showed displaced b and c triradius with a medially displaced d triradius and an abscence radial longitudinal crease. The t triradius was displaced distally.
    McGillivray and Lowry (1977) estimated the incidence of Poland syndrome in British Columbia to be 1 in 32,000 and their review of the literature suggests a similar incidence from other studies. Familial recurrence of cases of Poland syndrome, as strictly defined above, are extremely rare, but there are occasional reports of familial Poland syndrome (David, 1982; Rojas-Martinez et al., 1991), or the association of Poland with Poland-Moebius syndrome in the same family (Larrandaburu et al., 1999). Isolated absence of the pectoralis and shoulder girdle muscles without abnormalities of the limbs can be autosomal dominant (David and Winter, 1985). Bavinck and Weaver (1986) and others have suggested a vascular etiology for Poland syndrome, postulating vascular interruption around the sixth week of development. Hennekam (1990) reported a family where one individual had a Poland anomaly, another a hemifacial microsomia and another a neural tube defect. A vascular etiology was suggested.
    Bouvet et al., (1978) reported a case with left sided Poland anomaly, dextrocardia, stenosis of the left subclavian artery and absence of the left internal thoracic artery and Soltan and Holmes (1986) reviewed reports of familial cases of possible vascular disruption. Beer et al., (1996) reported a 17-year-old woman with a hypoplastic breast and ipsilateral missing pectoralis major where hypoplasia of the subclavian artery on the same side was demonstated. Bamforth et al., (1992) reported a case with dextrocardia, a diaphragmatic hernia and herniation of the liver through the thoracic wall and suggested that the anomalies could be explained by mesodermal disruption. Fraser et al., (1998) reported two cases with dextrocardia and discuss this association.
    Powell et al., (1993) reported a male infant with typical Poland anomaly of the chest wall, but with unusual limb defects. There was a contralateral ulnar ray defect with a hypoplastic ulna and radius and absence of the 4th and 5th fingers. Fryns and De Smet (1994) reported a case with microcephaly, neuronal migration defects and cortical atrophy. However a subsequent sib was born with primary microcephaly (Fryns and De Smet 1997). Some cases have been associated with genitourinary anomalies including renal agenesis, renal hypoplasia, duplication of the collecting system, ureterocele, reflux and hypospadias. Hegde et al., (1995) provide a good review of this group. Cobben et al., (1992) reported a case with features of Goldenhar syndrome and rib abnormalities.
    Karnak et al., (1998) reported a case with bilateral absence of the pectoralis major muscles. There was brachydactyly, particularly of the metacarpals, with cone shaped epiphyses. This case is likely to have Jeune syndrome as pointed out by Maroteaux and Le Merrer (1998).
    De Smet et al., (1998) reported two cases with symbrachydactyly of hands and feet but with no abnormalities of the pectoral muscles.</abstract>

    >Williams et al. first described this syndrome in 1961 and Beuren et al., (1962) expanded the phenotype. The main features are a characteristic face, heart defects, mental retardation with an outgoing personality and sometimes hypercalcaemia in infancy. The facial features consist of periorbital fullness, medial eyebrow flare, a stellate iris pattern, a flat nasal bridge, a flat malar region with full cheeks and lips, and a wide mouth with a long smooth philtrum. The facies may become coarser with age (Lopez-Rangel et al., 1992). Pankau et al., (1993) point out that radio-ulnar synostosis can be a feature in about 10% of cases (see also Bzduch, 1994). Scothorn and Butler (1997) reported a female case with precocious puberty. They suggest, anecdotally, that precocious puberty might be more common in Williams syndrome. MRI scans of the brain are usually normal (Brinkmann et al., 1997). Bawden et al., (1997) report their experience with using methylphenidate to treat hyperactivity in the disorder. Tsao and Westman (1997) reported two cases with infantile spasms. Cherniske et al., (1999) reported evidence for early puberty.
    The characteristic heart defect is a supravalvular aortic stenosis or a peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis can occur. Bird et al., (1996) reported 10 cases who suffered sudden death. Coronary artery stenosis and severe biventricular outflow tract obstruction seemed to be the main causes.
    Hypercalcaemia may be difficult to document by the time the child has developed the full clinical features, but occasionally it is severe and persists. Enamel hypoplasia, strabismus and inguinal hernias are common. Pober et al., (1993) studied 40 children with Williams syndrome and found that seven (18%) had renal anomalies, however only two had nephrocalcinosis - the remainder had abnormalities of size or shape of the kidneys. Mild renal artery stenosis was found in four out of nine patients studied, but only two had hypertension, which did not correlate with the renal artery stenosis. Pankau et al., (1996) examined 130 patients with Williams syndrome and found renal anomalies in 17.7%.  4-5% had renal agenesis or renal hypoplasia, 7% had a duplicated kidney, and around 6% had renal artery stenosis although hypertension was uncommon. Chodirker et al., (1997) reported 5 cases where a low maternal serum alpha feto-protein level was noted in pregnancy. .
    Ardinger et al., (1994) reported a 2-year-old boy with evidence of carotid and cerebral arterial stenosis with cerebral ischaemia. There was a very high ESR and some response to steroids and the possibility of a vasculitis was considered. Two other cases of cerebrovascular narrowing in patients with Williams syndrome were reviewed from the literature. Further cases with cerebrovascular abnormalities have also been reported (Greally et al., 1994; Kaplan et al., 1995; Soper et al., 1995; Wollack et al., 1996). Sadler et al., (1998) showed that the mean carotid wall thickness in Williams syndrome was significantly greater than controls.
    Balacco-Gabrieli et al., (1985) reported a case with Rieger anomaly and megaloureter. Pober and Filiano (1995) reported two cases with a Chiari type I malformation with fusion of the cervical spine. Mammi et al., (1996) reported a case who developed malignant hyperthermia after a general anesthestic. They review the literature on anesthetic complications. Colley et al., (1992) reported a 2 1/2 year old girl with an unbalanced de novo 13;18 translocation - 45,XX,-13,-18,+der(18), t(13;18)(q13;q23) who had many features of Williams syndrome. The diagnoses in the cases reported by Tupler et al., (1992) with a del(4q33-&lt;q35.1) and Telvi et al., (1992) with a t(X;21)(q28;q11) are highly dubious. 
    Curran et al., (1993) reported a disruption of the elastin gene at 7q11 in a family segregating for supravalvular aortic stenosis and a balanced translocation. Morris et al., (1993) suggested that the elastin gene on 7q11 may be involved in this syndrome, as cases with supravalvular aortic stenosis where disruption of the elastin gene has been demonstrated, have features of Williams syndrome. Ewart et al., (1993) identified hemizygosity of the elastin gene in four familial and five sporadic cases of Williams syndrome. Nickerson et al., (1995) studied 44 clinically diagnosed cases and found elastin gene deletions in 40 (91%). Lowery et al., (1995) studied 235 cases with classic Williams syndrome and found deletions in 96%. Mari et al., (1995) reported similar findings in a series of 60 patients. Cases without deletions were felt to be clinically atypical. Joyce et al., (1996) found deletions in 22 out of 23 cases with classical Williams syndrome. The remaining patient had an 11q13.5-14.2 interstitial deletion. Urban et al., (1996) and Baumer et al., (1998) presented data suggesting that deletions might be caused by unequal crossing over. Perez Jurado et al., (1996) presented data suggesting that a gene or genes within the Williams deletion might be imprinted. Individuals who carry the deletion on the maternal 7 are smaller than those with deletions on the paternal chromosome 7. Dutly and Schinzel (1996) demonstrated that most deletions were due to unequal crossing over at meiosis with a small proportion being due to intrachromosomal (i.e. between chromatids) rearrangements. Perez-Jurado et al., (1998) characterised the common deletion breakpoints and demonstrated a duplicated gene encoding BAP-135 a protein phosphorylated by Bruton's tryosine kinase in B-cell as well as the multiple functional transcription factor TFII-I. 
    Fryssira et al., (1997) reported a male with normal intelligence and no features of William's syndrome who had a deletion of the elastin gene by FISH analysis. Tassabehji et al., (1996) showed that the LIM kinase gene (LIMK1) is also deleted in Williams cases. This gene codes for a novel protein kinase that is likely to be a component of an intracellular signalling pathway involved in brain development.  Arber et al., (1998) and Yang et al., (1998) showed that LIMK1 acts through phosphorylation of cofilin. Cofilin appears to be the enzyme required for actin depolymerization - a process involved in cell movement (Rosenblatt and Mitchison 1998). LIMK was deleted in 20 out of 20 Williams syndrome patients also deleted for the elastin gene. Frangiskakis et al., (1996) showed that the LIM-kinase and elastin genes were deleted in two families with a partial Williams syndrome phenotype with developmental features of Williams syndrome and vascular abnormalities. They concluded that hemizygosity for the LIMK1 gene leads to impaired visuospatial constructive cognition. Wang et al., (1997) reported another gene, homologous to the Drosophila frizzled wnt receptor, that seem to be included in Williams deletions. Osborne et al., (1997) reported deletions of the Syntaxin 1A gene in cases of Williams syndrome. Botta et al., (1999) reported a patient not deleted for the Syntaxin 1A or frizzled genes with classical features of the condition. However Tassabehji et al., (1999) presented data suggesting that the LIMK1 and STX1A genes were not involved in any of the Williams phenotype. They confirm that deletion of the ELN gene was responsible for the cardiological features of Williams syndrome.
    Sadler et al., (1993), Morris et al., (1993) and Ounap et al., (1998) reported convincing parent to child transmission, although most cases are sporadic. Kara-Mostefa et al., (1999) reported sibs with an elastin gene deletion but normal parents. There was evidence suggesting maternal germ-line mosaicism. </abstract>

    >Also called an apical dystrophy, the extent of the changes can vary even within the same pedigree. The terminal portion of the index to the 5th fingers show absent or rudimentary nails and the toes show a similar pattern. The big toes and thumbs are spared. Syndactyly and symphalangism can occur and the mildest expression of the gene might be the fusion of the proximal and distal phalanges. Houlston and Temple (1994) reported a family with what seemed like a characteristic face. There was a high nasal bridge, a prominent nose with a bulbous tip, hypoplastic alae nasi, widely spaced eyes with downslanting palpebral fissures and a short philtrum. Santos et al., (1981) and Santos (1995) also reported a family where affected individuals had a prominent nose with a bulbous configuration. de Ravel et al., (1999) reported a brother and sister with brachydactyly type B with similar facial features to other reported patients. The parents had no clinical abnormalities. Gonadal mosaicism was suggested. The brother had markedly bulbous finger tip pads and nail aplasia. The authors suggest that brachydactyly type B and Cooks (1985) (qv) syndrome are identical abnormalities.
    Gong et al., (1999) mapped the gene to 9q in two families. Oldridge et al., (1999) also presented evidence of linkage to 9q22. Slavotinek and Clayton-Smith (1999) report a further case and review syndromes with similar digital abnormalities.</abstract>

    >This condition affects the nails, the skeleton and the kidney. The nails are abnormal from birth and are either absent or small and longitudinally ridged. Nails on the radial side of the hand are said to be more severely affected, so that the 4th and 5th finger nails may be relatively normal. Triangular lunules at the base of the nails are said to be particularly characteristic. Skeletal abnormalities include talipes equinovarus and other joint contractures, posterior iliac horns, a malformed capitellum of the radius, Madelung deformity and absent or hypoplastic patellae. Yarali et al., (1995) pointed out that a clavicular horn might also be a feature. Rizzo et al., (1993) reported a family with severe renal involvement where affected individuals also had antecubital pterygia and elbow contractures. Song et al., (1998) describe the treatment of a patient with this complication. Nephropathy may manifest with proteinuria or intermittent nephrotic syndrome and 8-10% will progress to renal failure.
    Drut et al., (1992) studied the kidneys of an 18-week spontaneously aborted fetus whose mother had nail-patella syndrome. They found features of nail-patella syndrome and suggested that prenatal diagnosis by fetal renal biopsy would be feasible. However, Gubler and Levy (1993) urged caution because of the variable nature of the nephropathy in nail-patella syndrome, and because nephropathy does not occur in all families. Feingold et al., (1998) reported prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound visualisation of iliac horns in the third trimester.
    Ghiggeri et al., (1993) demonstrated heterozygous deletion of COL5A1 and underexpression of alpha1 chains of type V collagen in a child with monosomy 9q32-qter, dysplastic nails, but normal patellae. She also had features of Goltz syndrome (qv), and the authors suggested that nail-patella syndrome may be caused by mutations within COL5A1, rather than by a deletion. However, Greenspan et al., (1995) failed to demonstrate linkage to COL5A1 in the pedigree previously reported by Schleuterman et al., (1969). Mutations in Col5A1 are now known to cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I. Duba et al., (1998) reported a case with an apparently balanced (9;17) (q34.1;q25) translocation.
    Dreyer et al., (1998) demonstrated mutations in the LMX1B gene. This codes for a LIM homeodomain protein which plays a role in dorso-ventral patterning in the vertebrate limb. Two premature stop mutations and a mutation predicted to disrupt the sequence specific DNA binding were detected. Further mutations were reported by Vollrath et al., (1998). Further mutations were reported by McIntosh et al., (1998).</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Several variants of thanatophoric dyplasia have been described. They are distinguished by subtle radiographic and histological differences from true thanatophoric dysplasia. Most cases have been sporadic. Spranger and Maroteaux (1991) review the various types, including the Torrance, San Diego, Luton and Shiraz types as well as two types from their registry that have not been reported before. van der Harten et al., (1993) give a good review of the radiological and histological features. Nishimura et al., (1998) reported a case with radiological features of the Luton type but histological features of the Torrance type.
    Steiner et al., (1995) report the prenatal diagnosis of a possible case using three-dimensional ultrasound. Freisinger et al., (1996) presented biochemical data for a type II collagen abnormality in a case with the Torrance variant of lethal platyspondylic dyplasia.
    Brodie et al., (1999) examined 22 cases with features of the thanatophoric dysplaisa variant phenotype and found thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 mutations (qv) in the FGFR3 gene in 17 cases with the San Diego phenotype. No mutations were found in the Torrance or Luton types. </abstract>

    >Cohen et al., (1992) estimated that Apert syndrome has a birth prevalence of about 1 in 65,000 with a mutation rate of 7.8 per 1,000,000 gametes per generation and accounts for 4.5% of all cases of craniosynostosis. It is one of the most serious of the craniosynostosis syndromes. Studies suggests that about 50% of affected individuals are mentally retarded (Patton et al., 1988, Sarimski 1997), although earlier studies had suggested a higher figure. Renier et al., (1996) showed that 68% of cases had an IQ below 70, although only 50% were retarded in those operated on before the age of one. Neuropathological studies can show polymicrogyria, hypoplastic white matter, heterotopic grey matter, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anomalies of the septum pellucidum. 
    At birth all the cranial sutures are abnormal, apart from the lambdoidal, and the head is tower-shaped, flat from front to back with a prominent forehead. The eyes are prominent, the nose beaked and the palate high, narrow and sometimes cleft. Fusion of cervical vertebrae, usually C5-6, is present in about 70% of cases. Common origin of the carotid arteries is also an association (Wells et al., 1993). The hands are characteristic with fusion of digits 2-5 and sometimes including the thumb - the so-called mitten hand. The nails on the fingers might be fused. The toes are similarly affected and preaxial polydactyly of the feet is occasionally seen (Maroteaux et al., 1987; Izumikawa et al., 1990). Post-axial polydactyly also occasionally occurs (Anderson et al., 1996).
    In later life the teeth are crowded and hydrocephalus might develop. Deafness and optic atrophy are other complications. Cohen and Kreiborg (1993) reviewed the incidence of visceral anomalies in 136 cases. Cardiovascular and genitourinary anomalies were found in about 10% of cases each. It was noted that a solid cartilaginous trachea was a feature of the condition. The same authors reviewed the skeletal abnormalities in Apert syndrome. They noted limited mobility of the shoulder joint with glenoid dysplasia, decreased elbow extension, short humeri, a delayed bone age with some evidence of epiphyseal dysplasia, and subluxation or dislocation of the radial heads.
    Most cases are fresh mutations. Dodson et al., (1970) reported a convincing case with a possible 2;12 translocation. Lewanda et al., (1993) reported a follow-up on this family and found that the normal father had the same balanced translocation, suggesting it was a coincidental finding.
    Wilkie et al., (1995) demonstrated mutations in the FGFR2 gene. Two mutations accounted for all 40 unrelated cases in the study. The mutations were Ser252Trp and Pro253Arg in adjacent amino acids of the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains of the protein. The latter mutation is homologous to mutations in FGFR1 giving rise to Pfeiffer syndrome (Muenke et al., 1994).  Moloney et al., (1996) showed that the C-&lt;G transversions giving rise to Apert syndrome occurred exclusively on the paternal chromosome in 57 cases.  Both Wilkie et al., (1995), Park et al., (1995) and Slaney et al., (1996) attempt to correlate clinical severity with mutation type. Slaney et al., (1996) found that cases with the Pro253Arg mutation had more severe syndactyly in both the hands and feet while cases with Ser252Trp mutations have a higher incidence of cleft palate. Oldridge et al,. (1997) reported a case with a Ser252Phe substitution with features of Apert syndrome. This required a double mutation in adjacent nucelotides. A case with a Ser252Leu substitution only had mild Crouzon syndrome and the same mutation was present in three unaffected family members. A double amino acid subsitution (Ser252Phe and Pro253Ser) caused a mild Pfeiffer syndrome phenotype. Note that Passos-Bueno et al., (1998) reported a case with an apparent standard Ser252Phe FGFR2 mutation with milder hand and foot abnormalities resembling Pfeiffer syndrome.
    Oldridge et al., (1999) reported two patients with unique mutations. These consisted of Alu-element insertions of ~360 bp in exon 9 in one case and upstream in exon 9 of another. There was evidence of ectopic expression of the KGFR isoform of FGFR2 in fibroblast lines.
    Anderson et al., (1998) showed that the common Apert mutations in the FGFR2 receptor caused increased affinity for FGF ligand.
    Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonographic and molecular means has been reported (Filkins et al., 1997).</abstract>

    >    Clinically the patients are very small with a short trunk and marked lordosis. Myopia, cleft palate and deafness can occur. Onset is at birth, but severe short stature may not be obvious until 2-3 years. In infancy the vertebral bodies are ovoid or pear-shaped but later platyspondyly with irregular endplates develops. Odontoid hypoplasia may be a problem. Bone age is markedly delayed and the epiphyses are flattened and fragmented. The capital femoral epiphysis is severely affected. Delay in ossification of the pubic rami is characteristic. 
    The condition may be separated into two types according to the presence of severe coxa vara or not (Wynne-Davies and Hall, 1982). In the former case, short stature is severe with a final height of between three and four feet. In the latter case final height might be between four and five feet.
    Congenital hypothyroidism should be ruled out as occasionally this can mimic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (Eberle, 1993; Wiedemann, 1994).
    Anderson, Goldberg et al., (1990) demonstrated linkage to COL2A1 in a four generation pedigree, however in another family with a milder autosomal dominant form of SED congenita they could not demonstrate linkage (Anderson, Tsipouras et al., 1990). 
    In contrast Ramesar and Beighton (1992) reported linkage to COL2A1 in a relatively mildly affected family. Tiller et al., (1990) and Cole et al., (1993) reported mutations in the COL2A1 and COL2A2 genes respectively. Tiller et al., (1995) reported an RNA-splicing mutation in COL2A1.</abstract>

    >This can be the most difficult form of mucopolysaccharidosis to diagnose because of the relatively mild dysmorphic features and the absence of mucopolysaccharides in the urine by some screening tests. Intellectual deterioration may be the presenting feature (Ozand et al., 1994), although mild coarsening of the facial features, hirsutism, or minimal signs of dysostosis multiplex may be noted. Growth can be mildly retarded, although increased growth with advanced bone age can occur early on. Recurrent diarrhoea might be part of the presenting symptoms. Thickening of the mitral valve can be severe. Corneal clouding and hepatosplenomegaly are usually absent.  Ramaswami et al., (1996) reported a case with type IIIB who presented with a transient renal tubular dysfunction at 10 weeks of age.
    Behaviour is extremely difficult to manage, as there is aggression and hyperactivity. Although initial progress is made, there is gradual regression and death usually occurs around the age of 20 in a bed-ridden individual.
    Biochemically the defect is in the breakdown of heparan sulphate. Four separate enzyme defects have been recognised, giving types A, B, C and D. Cleary and Wraith (1993) provide a good review of the behavioural aspects and management.
   Scott et al., (1995) cloned the sulphamidase gene and identified mutations in Sanfilippo A patients. Blanch et al., (1997) reported further mutations in Sanfilippo syndrome type A. They localised the gene to 17q25. Zhao et al., (1996) cloned the gene for type B. Genotype/phenotype correlation for type B mutations were reported by Zhao et al., (1998) and Schmidtchen et al., (1998). Further mutations were reported by Beesley et al., (1998) and Bunge et al., (1999).</abstract>

    >This is a form of low birth-weight dwarfism with autosomal recessive inheritance. The name derives from the initials of the first authors to describe the condition. The face is said to be 'hatchet-shaped' when viewed from the side and there can be relative macrocephaly. The heels are prominent. Radiographs reveal slender ribs and long bones, and tall vertebrae. These features are rather subjective so that there is a distinct risk of over-diagnosis. Mueller et al., (1992) reported a possible male case with intracranial cerebral vascular aneurysms.</abstract>

    >The cutaneous manifestations of this condition are linear, verrucous, pigmented lesions, ichthyosis hystrix, acanthosis nigricans, haemangiomas and cafe au lait spots. Associated complications include mental retardation (Feuerstein-Mims syndrome), seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, renal tumours, vitamin D-resistant rickets, bone cysts and deformity, and kyphosis/scoliosis. O'Neill (1993) reported a case with diffuse pulmonary haemangiomatosis, vitamin D dependent rickets and bone cysts. Tay et al., (1996) reported a case associated with a woolly hair nevus. There was also precocious puberty. Oram et al., (1996) reported an 8-year-old boy with a linear epidermal nevus associated with psoriasis but this might  just have been a coincidence.
    Happle et al., (1996) reviewed six patients with epidermal nevi associated with speckled lentiginous nevi in a distribution suggesting 'twin spotting'. One patient had a diffuse ichthyosis-like hyperkeratosis suggesting that there was a heterozygous abnormal gene in the hyperkeratotic skin and a homozygous mutation secondary to somatic recombination in the epidermal nevus. Schworm et al., (1996) reported discordant monozygotic twins.
    Epibulbar dermoids (choristomas) appear to be associated (Monahan et al., 1967; Mansour et al., 1984; Diven et al., 1987; Mullaney et al., 1996; Shields et al., 1997) - some of these cases may have encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (qv). Other ocular abnormalities are reviewed by Diven et al., (1987). Chorioretinal colobomas are common. Shochot et al., (1982) reported a case with skin tags or hamartomas of the outer canthi, suggesting some overlap with Delleman (qv). A similar case was reported by Mullaney and Weatherhead (1996) with what was interpreted as a complex choristoma and bilateral choroidal osteoma. Taboada et al., (1993) reported a 32-year-old male with a sebaceous nevus of the scalp and mediastinal lipomas. Chatkupt et al., (1993) reported a case associated with spinal arteriovenous malformations and reviewed the literature concerning this complication.
    Monk et al., (1982) and Sahl (1990) have reported linear sebaceous nevi of the scalp in more than one generation of a family, however these don't seem to have been associated with neurological complications. Further possible familial cases were reported by Meschia et al., (1992) who reviewed other families in the literature.
    Pavone et al., (1991), Sakuta et al., (1989 and 1991), El-Shanti et al., (1992) and Brodsky et al., (1997) have reported cases with hemimegalencephaly, porencephaly, schizencephaly and/or asymmetrical lipomas of the face. Dodge and Dobyns (1995) reported a female case with hemimegalencephaly associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum and a Dandy-Walker malformation. She also had an iris coloboma and hemivertebrae at T8 and T9. Again, there may be overlap here with encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis or a localised form of Proteus syndrome (qv). Gurecki et al., (1996) review the range of CNS abnormalities in this condition.
    Fryburg and Greer (1993) reported a case with aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp associated with occipital bullae.
    Stosiek et al., (1994) reported two cases where biopsy of epidermal verrucous nevi demonstrated chromosome abnormalities. One case had mosaicism for a (1;12)(q23;q23) translocation in one culture, and a variety of different chromosome abnormalities in another culture. The other case had mosaicism for deletion of 1q23-qter. These results suggest a possible genetic location on 1q23. Zamora and Vazquez-Doval (1997) reported a 29 year old woman with epidermal naevi associated with trichilemmal cysts. She was found to be mosaic for an apparently balanced chromosome translocation (1p36;9q34).</abstract>

    >    This is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by platyspondyly and metaphyseal changes of the long bones. Onset is in infancy or childhood with progressive shortening of the trunk and abnormal gait. On radiography, as well as platyspondyly there is mild irregularity of the endplates of the vertebrae and metaphyseal irregularity of the long bones. The femoral necks are broad and short with progressive coxa vara. Carter et al., (1985) described a case with nephrotic syndrome secondary to glomerulosclerosis. Bagga described a case with hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia that otherwise resembled the case of Kozlowski (1973).
      The classification of the spondylometaphyseal dysplasias is still problematical. Kozlowski et al., (1982) and Maroteaux and Spranger (1991) propose tentative classification schemes. 
    Spranger (1993) points out that the cases reported by Diren et al., (1992) have Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome. </abstract>

    >    A lethal short rib dwarfism was described in two unrelated infants (Beemer et al., 1983). The parents of one were consanguineous. Both had generalized oedema or hydrops, large heads, a flat face with a midline cleft lip (one had a cleft palate), epicanthic folds, a flat nasal bridge, small almost atretic auditary canals, short necks with nuchal oedema, protuberant abdomens with an omphalocele and a small penis with fused labioscrotal folds in the male (the other was a female). There was no polydactyly or renal cysts. Radiologically the ribs were short with irregularity and widening anteriorly and the long tubular bones were short with minimal bowing of the femora whereas the radius and ulna were markedly bowed. There was no metaphyseal irregularity. Winter (1988) described a further case. Yang et al., (1991) described a case with unilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hand, hydronephrosis, holoprosencephaly and a Dandy-Walker cyst. Lin et al., (1991) noted similarities to the OFD syndromes. They described a case with facial milia and multiple oral frenula. Lurie (1994) points out that preaxial polydactyly, natal teeth, clefting of the tongue and brain abnormalities are all features of the condition. The case reported by Benallegue et al., (1987) had a clover-leaf skull. Chen et al., (1994) reported a case with a de novo 17q paracentric inversion (17q21:q23).
    Tsai et al., (1992) reported a hydropic fetus with some features of the condition but with postaxial polydactyly - they reviewed the overlap with other short rib-polydactyly syndromes.
    Cideciyan et al., (1993) reported a 37-week infant with features of this condition. He also had renal cystic dysplasia, intrahepatic bile duct cysts with periportal fibrosis, pancreatic cysts, absent internal genitalia, absent optic nerves, polymicrogyria and partial holoprosencephaly.
    Brenner et al., (1993) reported histological studies of the growth plate in an affected case and showed a reduced proliferation zone and an enlarged zone of hypertrophic cartilage. Islands of persistent hypertrophic cartilage were present in the metaphysis. Elcioglu et al., (1996) reported affected female twins.

    >This short stature syndrome was first reported by Maroteaux et al., (1971). As the name implies the shortest segments are the forearms, lower legs, hands and feet. The short stature might be noted at birth but mostly becomes obvious during the first year of life. The forearms are bowed and the fingers and toes are very short. The head is relatively large with frontal bossing. The radial head might be dislocated. Eventual stature is below the 3rd centile. Delayed gonadal function has been reported in some patients and very occasionally corneal ulcers have occurred. The condition has been well reviewed by Langer et al., (1977). Radiologically there are short and broad proximal and middle phalanges, cone shaped epiphyses and invaginated metaphyses. The forearm bones are shorter than the humerus. The vertebral bodies have a central anterior protrusion. Many cases appear to be autosomal recessive but Ohba et al., (1989) reported an affected father and son, suggesting possible autosomal dominant inheritance. Minty and Hall (1993) reported a brother and sister with the condition who both had hypomagnesaemia. The brother also had hypocalcaemia that responded to oral calcium supplements.
    Ferraz et al., (1997) reported an affected mother and son with what they felt was a variant form of the condition. The radii were curved and there was unusual slight angulation of the distal ulnar in the mother. The hands were short with marked shortening of the second and fifth fingers. A good review of  the genetics of the condition is provided.</abstract>

    >This is a distinct form of sclerosing bone dysplasia. Affected indivuals are usually tall with a large head, a prominent forehead and a large mandible. Syndactyly of digits 2 and 3 can be seen, which may be either cutaneous or bony. There may be radial deviation of the terminal phalanges. Radiographs reveal increased density of the bones of the skull with enlarged frontal sinuses, enlarged sella turcica and sclerosis of the cranial foramina. The mandible becomes massively enlarged and there is usually hypodontia. In the spine the pedicles and laminae of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae show increased density, but the vertebral bodies are normal. The tubular bones are massive with cortical thickening and disturbance of modelling. Onset is after 5 years. Progressive cranial nerve palsies may lead to facial paralysis, deafness and optic atrophy. (However Beighton and Hamersma (1985) found that there was no visual loss due to optic nerve compression in a series of 45 patients). The condition is autosomal recessive and most cases have been described in individuals of Dutch ancestry, especially in the Afrikaner population of South Africa. Sugiura and Yasuhara (1975) reported a Japanese case and Bueno et al., (1994) a Spanish case.
    Balemans et al., (1999) mapped the gene to 17q12-q21 in the same region as van Buchem disease in the family reported by Paes-Alves et al., (1982) and the family reported by Stein et al., (1983).</abstract>

    >    Over 25 patients have been described with this condition. The main features are mental retardation, severe generalised osteoporosis, hypotonia, loose joints and blindness. Affected individuals may be congenitally blind, but visual problems can also be progressive up to the age of 15 years. Ophthalmological examination reveals microphthalmia, corneal opacities, a shallow anterior chamber, iris atrophy, posterior synechiae, lens opacities and a white retrolental mass. Phthisis bulbi may ensue. Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous maybe a feature (Steichen-Gersdorf et al., 1997). Gong et al., (1996) mapped the gene to 11q12-13 in three different consanguineous kindreds.</abstract>

    >A rare form of bone dysplasia that resembles Kniest dysplasia, this condition gets its name from the Greek for changing pattern; short-limbed dwarfism is present at birth but the back gradually becomes shorter with age. The joints are prominent, the chest narrow and there may be a caudal appendage overlying the sacrum. Radiographs reveal flaring of the metaphyses with flattened deformed epiphyses. The ribs are short with flaring and cupping of the anterior borders. The vertebrae become flattened with age with a characteristic anterior tongue of bone on lateral view. The fingers and toes may be very long. Severe kyphosis develops. It has been suggested that inheritance is autosomal recessive (Beck et al., 1983), but a dominant form seems to exist and 'recessive' cases could be caused by parental mosaicism. There is a variation in severity and a neonatal lethal form has been described (Kozlowski et al., 1976; Shanske et al., 1982) - however this needs to be carefully differentiated from fibrochondrogenesis (qv).</abstract>

    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This autosomal recessive condition presents with a combination of a pancytopenia with mean age of onset of about 8 years, a tendency to leukaemia, and congenital anomalies. The most obvious malformations concern the hands, in which hypoplasia of the thumbs, or occasionally supernumerary thumbs, are seen, and in the forearm where hypoplasia of the radius is common. Microcephaly, mental retardation and growth retardation are features, and bilateral mild hearing loss, with or without malformation of the ears, can all occur. Characteristic cafe au lait patches may be seen. These have a ragged outline. Renal abnormalities, which occur in a quarter to a third of patients, are variable, and may include complete absence of one kidney, hypoplasia, or horseshoe kidney or double ureters. It should be noted that Fanconi pancytopenia can present with haematological features alone, without any malformations, but perhaps with short stature (Butturini et al., 1994). Giampietro et al., (1997) found that about a third of patients had no congenital malformations. Of this group, about 45% had a height less than the 5th centile and most had minor anomalies such as cafe au lait spots or short palpebral fissures. Alter and Tenner (1994) reported cousins with the condition, one of whom developed a possible medulloblastoma (autopsy was refused) and the other an astrocytoma. Griffin et al., (1992) have also reported a case with a cerebellar medulloblastoma. There have been two patients with Fanconi anaemia who have developed moyamoya disease and both had identical mutations in the Fanconi anaemia complementation C gene (see below). They were heterozygous for 322 delG and R185X (Pavlakis et al., 1995).
    Spontaneous chromosome breakage and quadriradials should be looked for and mitomycin C-treated cultures should also be examined. However false-negatives are possible. Auerbach et al., (1981; 1989) have recommended the use of the DNA clastogen diepoxybutane for the investigation of possible Fanconi cases. Howell (1991) recommends a BUdr method.
    Note that some infants with hydrocephalus and VATER association have been suggested to have Fanconi pancytopenia (see hydrocephaly with features of VATER syndrome) (Porteous et al., 1992; Toriello et al., 1993; Alter, 1993). Evans et al., (1994) reported two families where infants had the combination of duodenal or other bowel atresia, radial ray defects, renal ectopia and hydrocephalus. Cox et al., (1997) demonstrated mutations in the FA(C) (see below) gene in opposite sex twins with this association. Perel et al., (1998) reported three affected children with oesophageal atresia, one who had other features of VATER association.
     Joenje et al., (1997) presented evidence for at least 8 Fanconi anemia genes. Strathdee et al., (1992) presented evidence for at least four complementation groups, isolated the gene for group FA(C) and demonstrated that it mapped to 9q22. Whitney et al., (1993) demonstrated a common splice mutation (IVS4) in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FA(C). Auerbach et al., (1997) estimates the carrier frequency to be 1 in 89 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population for the IFS2 mutation. This mutation has not been found in non-Jewish patients. Gibson et al., (1994) refined the linkage of the FA(C) gene on 9q and showed that approximately 8% of families were in this complementation group. Using the linked markers 56% of families could be excluded from this group, obviating the need for mutation analysis. The most common complementation group is FA(A), responsible for about two thirds of cases. Pronk et al., (1995) localised this gene to 16q24.3. Gschwend et al., (1996) confirmed this localisation. Apostolou et al., (1996) and Lo Ten Foe et al., (1996) isolated the gene for FA(A) by positional cloning. It encodes a protein of 1455 amino acids that has no significant homology to any other known proteins. Wijker et al., (1999) reported further mutations in the group A gene. Lightfoot et al., (1999) reported further mutations in the FA(A) gene and studied the functional effects of these mutations. FA(D) accounts for about 4.3% of cases and has been localised to 3p22-26 (Whitney et al., 1995). Joenje et al., (1996) looked at the distribution of subtypes in Germany and The Netherlands. Complementation group A was most prevalent in Germany (59%) whereas group C was the most common in The Netherlands (67%). Saar et al., (1998) mapped another gene to 9p13 belonging to complementation groups F, G, H. de Winter et al,. (1998) demonstrated that this gene was the XRCC9 gene coding for a protein involved in DNA post-replication repair or cell cycle checkpoint control.  Wegner et al., (1996) reported the clinical features in a case from complementation group E. These included growth retardation, a retarded bone age, hypotelorism, syndactyly, brachydactyly, renal dystopia, cryptorchidism, a hypoplastic thumb on one side and a double distal phalanx on the other. Waisfisz et al., (1999) mapped the group E gene to 6p21-22. 
    Guinan et al., (1994) reported a study of treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in seven patients. Six patients showed an increase in the neutrophil count but there was not a significant amelioration of the anaemia.
    Alter (1993) provides a good clinical review and Taylor et al., (1994) review the complex biochemical abnormalities. Buchwald (1995) provides a review of the molecular progress up to the end of 1995. Lo Ten Foe et al., (1997) studied the phenomenon of somatic mosaicism in some patients, as evidenced by the presence of lymphocytes not sensitive to cross-linking agents. Their results suggested that normal alleles were generated either by intragenic mitotic recombination or gene conversion. Woods (1998) and Auerbach and Verlander (1997) provide good reviews of DNA repair defects.

Onset is around 2-3 years with growth retardation, kyphosis, genu valgum and pectus carinatum. Cloudy corneae and coarse facies develop. Radiological features resemble those of Hurler syndrome; hypoplasia of the odontoid process leading to atlantoaxial subluxation is a complication. Cardiac involvement is common with infiltration of the valves and heart failure. Hayflick et al., (1992) reported a 5-month-old girl with a cardiomyopathy and reviewed the literature concerning this association. Survival may be into the twenties. The biochemical defect is a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulphatase B) leading to increased excretion of dermatan sulphate. The gene has been isolated and mutations demonstrated (Litjens et al., 1996). There is a more severe sub-type with rapid deterioration and severe deformity before the age of ten years.
    A long term follow-up of 4 patients after a bone marrow transplant was reported by Herskhovitz et al., (1999). The facial coarseness and cardiac manifestations improved, but the skeletal changes persisted and even progressed.     </abstract>

    >This autosomal recessive storage disorder results from accumulation of mannose-containing residues due to a deficiency of alpha-mannosidase. The phenotype resembles a mucopolysaccharidosis but is generally milder with moderate coarsening of the face becoming apparent after 2-3 years, a lumbar gibbus, sensorineural deafness, hepatomegaly and dysostosis multiplex on X-ray. All cases have mild to moderate mental retardation. Diagnosis is made by finding vacuolated lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, abnormal oligosaccharides in the urine and reduced enzyme levels. There is a severe infantile form (type I) with rapid mental deterioration and a milder juvenile form (type II), although there is considerable overlap between the two. Michelakakis et al., (1992) stressed the variability of the juvenile form and presented two sibs, one with coarse facial features and one with normal facies. Eckhoff and Garlock (1992) reported a 39-year-old male with the condition who had arthropathy of the large joints. Nilseen et al., (1997) cloned the gene and identified mutations in two affected sibs. Further mutations in severe and mild cases were reported by Gotoda et al., (1998) and Berg et al., (1999).</abstract>

    >Two brothers, the offspring of first-cousin gipsy parents, were described by Ventruto and Catani (1986). They both had a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad nasal tip and a short columella. Both had club foot, a gap between the first and second toes, mild hyper-extension of the joints, inguinal hernias and a short trunk. Scoliosis and a thoracic lordosis were present. Radiographs revealed unilateral defective segmentation of the posterior arches of the vertebrae (an unsegmented fusion bar between T6-T12). Similarities to two sibs reported by Akbarnia and Moe (1978) were noted.
    Wiles et al., (1992) reported three sibs, the offspring of Lebanese parents, with short trunk-type short stature, scoliosis and a rigid spine. Radiographs revealed fusion of cervical and thoracic vertebral bodies (including fusion of the posterior elements) and synostosis of the hamate/capitate or lunate/triquetrum. If the fusion on the spine is unilateral (an 'unsegmented fusion bar') scoliosis can result. The authors noted similarities to two previously reported cases (Langer and Moe, 1975; Akbarnia and Moe, 1978). Jones (1973b) (qv) describes a similar condition.
    Langer et al., (1994) reported six further cases and provide a good review of the literature. Sensorineural or conductive hearing loss appears to be part of the syndrome. One of Langer et al.'s cases had postaxial polydactyly and one a preauricular skin tag. Coelho et al., (1998) reported three further cases.

    >    The clinical picture is usually that of a neonate with a very small chest, causing respiratory problems, and variable shortening of the limbs. Possibly half of all cases have a post-axial polydactyly. The limb shortening is usually rhizomelic and the condition might be mistaken for achondroplasia, but the facial contours are normal. Patients often die in infancy because of respiratory insufficiency. Radiological confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The ribs are short, and the ilia of the pelvis are small with irregularity of the acetabulum, from which a medial bony projection is visible. Premature ossification of the capital femoral epiphyses is typically seen in the newborn. In those who survive, chronic renal failure is a common cause of death. Cystic changes are found in the kidney, but later there is peri-glomerular fibrosis. The picture can resemble juvenile nephronophthisis. Cirrhosis can also be a cause of early morbidity (Hudgins et al., 1992). Wilson et al., (1987) reviewed cases of Jeune syndrome with retinal dystrophy - this is a known association. Singh et al., (1988) reported four patients, including two sibs, with the condition who also had mild congenital hydrocephalus. Three patients had postaxial polydactyly. Brueton et al., (1990) and Majewski et al., (1996) reported cases with additional features of Ivemark syndrome with situs inversus and cardiac malformations.
    Nagai et al., (1995) reported a 5 1/2-year-old male with some features of the condition who had a 12p11-p12 deletion. Bahring et al ., (1997) point out that the hand abnormalities in this boy are very similar to that seen in Bilginturan Brachydactyly that maps to 12p.

    >    The infantile form of this lysosomal storage disease has an age of onset during the first months of life with progressive growth and neurological impairment. The condition is progressive and most cases die within the first two years of life from an intercurrent infection. Facial features are coarse, the head is usually large, and in the retina there is frequently a cherry red spot. The liver and spleen are enlarged and X-rays of the bones show dysostosis multiplex. Infants are usually hypotonic and often have seizures. Mendez et al., (1993) suggested that extensive mongolian blue spots might be a feature in infancy. 
    Vacuolated lymphyocytes and an absent beta-galatosidase confirms the diagnosis. It should be noted that the clinical picture is variable. Some infants present with fetal hydrops, others as above. There are also juvenile and adult onset forms which are not dysmorphic. Nardocci et al., (1993) reported a 13-year-old boy with the condition. Onset was at the age of 3 years with impairment of gait and dysarthria. At the age of 6, dystonia became apparent and there was mental deterioration. This boy seemed to have features of adult-onset GM1 gangliosidosis but with late-infantile onset.</abstract>

    >    This syndrome was first described by Shwachman et al., (1964) and Bodian et al., (1964). The main features are pancreatic insufficiency, neutropenia, short stature and a metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. The pancreatic insufficiency manifests with failure to thrive and steatorrhea from early infancy. Bicarbonate and digestive enzyme secretions are reduced even with pancreatic stimulation. Neutropenia is usually constant, although it can be cyclical in some cases. More severe haematological dysfunction may occur, including leukaemia (reviewed by Woods et al., 1981). Metaphyseal changes consist of flaring and shortening of the ribs with changes at the proximal femora and around the knees. Slipping of the femoral head, coxa vara and progressive changes in the proximal femoral metaphyses cause walking difficulties (Dhar and Anderton, 1994). Valgus deformity of the elbows and knees and thoracic dystrophy due to short ribs can be seen. An ichthyotic maculopapular rash is present in 60% of cases (Goeteyn et al., 1991). Smith et al., (1996) reviewed the haematological features of the condition. All patients in their series of 21 cases had neutropenia which was intermittent in two thirds. HbF was elevated in 80% of cases. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia was seen in 66% and 24% of cases respectively. A myelodysplastic syndrome was present in a third of cases and in 24% of these acute myeloid leukaemia occurred.
    Masuno et al., (1995) reported a case with a de novo balanced 6;12 (q16.2;q21.2) translocation.</abstract>

    >This condition has many features in common with acrocallosal, Meckel and hydrolethalus syndromes. It is well reviewed by Verloes et al., (1992). The main features are frontonasal dysplasia, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, postaxial polydactyly, a posterior encephalocoele, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation, tibial hypoplasia, and an epibulbar dermoid. Not all cases have a 'full-house' so that differentiation from the above syndromes can be difficult - see Toriello et al., (1986), for example. Most cases are sporadic, but Warkany et al., (1973) reported affected maternal half-sisters and Gorlin et al., (1990) mention affected identical twins and parental consanguinity in unpublished cases.
    The girl reported by Sueldo and Fernandes (1993) most likely had this condition (Verloes, 1994). She had, in addition, an absent left tibia and crossed-fused renal ectopia with duplication of the collecting system. Five further cases were reported by Slaney et al., (1999) together with a good review.</abstract>

    >    The hallmarks of this condition are a form of metaphyseal dysplasia, short stature, fine, sparse, blond hair, a transient macrocytic anaemia (and an occasional hypoplastic anaemia) and an immunodeficiency. The median adult height in males is 131cm and in females 123cm (Makitie et al., 1992). There is a particular susceptibility to varicella, indicating a defect of cellular immunity, but immunoglobulins are also deficient and neutropenia and lymphopenia can be seen. In the lower limbs the metaphyseal dysplasia is said to be more severe at the knee than at the proximal femur.  Berthet et al., (1996) reported a case where bone marrow transplantation corrected the immunodeficiency, but not the skeletal abnormalities.  Some cases have had aganglionic megacolon. van der Burgt et al., (1991), Makitie and Kaitila (1993), and Makitie et al., (1995) provide good reviews. In the study of Makitie (1992) 7 out of 107 died in the first year of life. 
    Gorlin (1992) mentions that Hodgkin disease may be a rare complication (on the basis of two cases).
    Le Merrer and Maroteaux (1991) point out that the radiological appearances in infancy may be deceptive. At birth the long bones are 'short and massive' and the metaphyses wide. The knee epiphyses are round. These authors also suggest that 'round femoral epiphysis dysplasia' may be a more severe form of the same condition.
    Sulisalo et al., (1993) assigned the gene to chromosome 9 by linkage analysis. The condition was linked to markers spanning the centromere. Sulisalo et al., (1995) used linked markers for prenatal diagnosis. Sulisalo et al., (1997) found two cases caused by uniparental disomy out of 54 'uniplex' families. 
    Dungan et al., (1996) reported prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination at 17 weeks.

    >    This form of mucopolysaccharidosis is subdivided according to the particular enzyme defect responsible (see Beck et al., 1986). Clinically the condition is characterised by severe skeletal abnormalities with cloudy corneae and aortic regurgitation. Onset may be in the first two years of life with genu valgum, a short trunk and neck, pectus carinatum and coarse facies. Clouding of the cornea is mild but deafness may be a problem. The joints may be loose without the claw hand seen in other mucopolysaccharidoses. Odontoid hypoplasia leads to atlantoaxial instability. Radiographs reveal severe dysostosis multiplex. Patients with the severe form may not survive beyond their twenties. Intelligence is often normal. Northover et al., (1996) provide a good review of type A.</abstract>

    >    Patients usually present with short stature and bowing of the radius, ulna, tibia and fibula. Compared with the Schmid type, the condition is much more severe. Hypercalcaemia may be present in infancy and the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is sometimes suggested, although Kruse and Schutz (1993) found low levels of serum PTH and PTH related peptide. Joint mobility is often restricted and club feet might be a feature. The radiological features consist of clubbing of the metaphyses, which are wide and irregularly calcified. The cupped and frayed appearance of the metaphyses can also be seen in the bones of the fingers. Deafness due to sclerosis of the base of the skull can occur in adulthood. Craniosynostosis can occur (personal observation), and a narrow thorax might be a feature (Ozonoff, 1974). Schipani et al., (1995) showed mutations in the gene encoding the parathyroid hormone-parathyroid-hormone-related peptide receptor (PTH-PTHrP receptor) in a patient with the condition. This causes a constitutively active receptor which explains the hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia seen in the condition. Schipani et al., (1996) studied six further cases, demonstrating mutations and also showing constitutively active PTH-PTHrP receptors in kidney, bone and growth-plate chondrocytes.</abstract>

    >Originally described in two sibs (one male, one female) this syndrome has subtle but distinctive features. The head has been described as a figure '8' shape (Dr D. Donnai, personal communication); viewed from the front the forehead is tall and prominent, there is severe temporal narrowing, and the cheeks are rather chubby. A groove under the eyes is characteristic and the earlobes are fleshy and anteriorly displaced. The nails are narrow and deep-set and post-axial polydactyly has been reported in some cases. Generalised hirsutism, talipes equinovarus and hypospadias in males are common. At post-mortem examination choanal atresia, hydronephrosis and hydroureter, and congenital heart defects are seen. Radiology reveals sclerosis of the base of the skull, a gap in the occipital bone, broad ribs, curved long bones and hypoplastic phalanges. Maclennan et al., (1991) described a case where increasing ventriculomegaly, intraventricular bands, and subependymal pseudocysts were shown by ultrasound of the head.  Elliott et al., (1996) reported a case with steatosis in the liver as well as lipid vacuolization of the zona fasciculata of the adrenals.  A severe degree of leukomalacia was demonstrated on pathological examination of the brain. Shah et al., (1999) reported a case with significant loss of peripheral white matter and cortical grey matter, ventriculomegaly, persistent bilateral choroid plexus cysts and diminished myelination in peripheral white matter at the age of 2. It was suggested that these findings were consistent with a severe metabolic defect.
    Robin et al., (1993) reported a case with a sacrococcygeal teratoma and noted that a previous case reported by Burck (1982) had a malignant hepatoblastoma. The authors postulated that risk of malignancy may be a component of the syndrome. Antich et al., (1995) and McPherson et al., (1998) reported a further case with a sacrococcygeal teratoma. Rodriguez et al., (1994) reported a case with a tumour in the lumbosacral area that was shown histologically to consist of a hypercellular mass of neuroectodermal embryonic cells. This child had complete skin syndactyly of fingers 4-5 on the right and 3-5 on the left.
    Labrune et al., (1994) reported three further cases and provide a good review of the syndrome.
    Santos et al., (1994) reported a case with hypothyroidism and diabetes insipidus. Ozkinay et al., (1996) reported a case with agenesis of the corpus callosum, who had a 47, XXY karyotype.</abstract>

    >    At birth these infants have hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, micrognathia, posteriorly rotated ears, a prominent forehead, microstomia and a cleft palate. In the limbs there is dislocation of the hips, flexed overlapping fingers, syndactyly, notched or bifid terminal phalanges, post-axial polydactyly and short halluces and thumbs. Radiographs reveal dense bones, curved or wavy long bones, wavy short ribs, sloping clavicles and spread-out ilia with high thick ischia and flat acetabulae. As the child grows the facial features become less severe, the bone curvature improves and the osteosclerosis of the long bones lessens.
    There are similarities to the severe form of Melnick-Needles syndrome in males, and this condition may indeed be allelic. In fact, Stillman et al., (1991), Blanchet et al., (1993) and Young et al., (1993) reported male infants with many features of OPD type II who had exomphalos/omphalocele, a feature usually associated with the severe form of Melnick-Needles syndrome. The case of Stratton and Bluestone (1991) is also difficult to classify as no radiographs were published or even described. This could represent a severe Melnick-Needles syndrome or perhaps a form of oro-facio-digital syndrome.
    Eccles et al., (1994) reported a possible case detected prenatally by ultrasound examination.
    The case reported by Stoll and Alembik (1994) had relatively mild features and the precise classification between type I and type II in this case is not clear. Horn et al., (1995) reported two brothers where there were similar diagnostic difficulties.
    It is possible that Melnick-Needles syndrome is allelic to the Oto-Palato-Digital syndromes as there is considerable phenotypic overlap (Robertson et al., 1997; Nishimura et al., 1997; Corona-Rivera 1999).  </abstract>

    >This X-linked dominant syndrome was first described by Melnick and Needles (1966). There has been a predominance of female cases and this is thought to be due to the severe effects of the gene in male hemizygotes, especially where the mother carries the gene. There is usually short stature with prominent eyes, full cheeks, a small chin with malalignment of the teeth and a prominent forehead. Radiographs reveal delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, sclerosis of the base of the skull, micrognathia with an increased mandibular angle, thin 'wavy' ribs, an increased height of the vertebral bodies, coxa valga and an 'S' shape to the long bones. Severely affected males can have more severe radiological features with exomphalos, an absent hallux, mild skin syndactyly and an absent cornea. Wong and Bofinger et al., (1997) reported a case with noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium. Sporadic males resemble affected females, indicating a possible maternal effect in the male cases where the mother is affected.
       The female infant described by Gardner et al., (1990) as a 'new syndrome' possibly had this condition although she was severely affected. The female dizygotic twins reported by Kozlowski et al., (1992) with hooked clavicles and 13 pairs of ribs have many features in common with Melnick-Needles syndrome. As they were only evaluated at 10 months of age it is difficult to say whether they have a separate syndrome, as claimed by the authors. Ades et al., (1995) provide further information on these cases at the age of nearly 4 years. From the description of radiographs Melnick-Needles syndrome still seems a possibility, although Ades et al., (1995) suggest a diagnosis of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome.
    It is possible that Melnick-Needles syndrome is allelic to the Oto-Palato-Digital syndromes as there is considerable phenotypic overlap (Robertson et al., 1997; Nishimura et al., 1997; Corona-Rivera et al., 1999). See also the discussion between Kozlowski (1999) and Robertson (1999).</abstract>

    >This condition was named by Maroteaux et al., (1984) after the Greek for delay in maturity; it had previously been described by Zonana et al., (1977). The main features of the condition are markedly delayed bone maturation, shortening of the phalanges, metacarpals and metatarsals with concave metaphyses, severe platyspondyly or absence of ossification of the vertebral bodies, square iliac bones, horizontal acetabulae with medial and lateral spurs, and delayed ossification of the ischiopubic bones. The thorax is narrow and there is rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. The fingers are short and stubby, but all appear to be almost of the same length. The face shows frontal bossing, a short nose with a depressed nasal bridge, and a long philtrum. Histopathology reveals a wide and irregular hypertrophic zone of the growth cartilage with wide connective tissue septa. Balloon-shaped cells with abnormal lacunae and inclusions are seen. Maroteaux et al., (1984) reported opposite sex sibs and Beemer and Kozlowski (1994) reported a 3-year-old boy, the offspring of first cousins. Santos and Saraiva (1995) also reported a male case who was the offspring of first cousins.</abstract>

    >    This condition should not be confused with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (McCune-Albright syndrome). Onset is in the first two decades with painless deformity of the lower leg leading to bowing. Hindman et al., (1996) report two cases presenting in the neonatal period. Radiographs in the early stages reveal an expansile lytic lesion of the tibia and/or fibula, with a sclerotic rim. The lesions tend to regress with age, but pathological fractures can occur. In infancy the differential diagnosis includes pseudarthrosis of the tibia secondary to neurofibromatosis. Ishida et al., (1992) reported twelve cases of osteofibrous dysplasia and two cases of differentiated adamantinoma. They suggested that the two types of lesion share the same histogenetic origin. See also Markel (1978) for a discussion of this association. Park et al., (1993) reviewed 80 cases and commented that no cases progressed to adamantinoma. Wang et al., (1992) reported two cases with involvement of the radius and ulna. </abstract>

    >    There might be a syndrome manifesting with multiple non-ossifying fibromas of the bone, giant cell granulomas of the jaws and cafe au lait spots. The bone lesions are described as lucent areas in the cortex of the shaft with a sclerotic margin. They are mainly situated in the metaphyses but may extend into the diaphyses. They appear symmetrically in the long bones and also affect the pelvis. Campanacci et al., (1983) reported ten patients and noted the association with mental retardation, hypogonadism, cardiovascular abnormalities and eye abnormalities. Kotzot et al., (1994) reported a 27-year-old female case and provide a good review of the literature. The condition must be carefully distinguished from neurofibromatosis and McCune-Albright syndrome.
    Kozlowski et al., (1993) reported a mother and daughter with multiple, symmetrical non-ossifying fibromata, but without extraosseous abnormalities. This may be a separate condition from Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome.</abstract>

  <Syndrome rdf:ID="SYN1172">
    <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >This syndrome was first described by Noonan and Ehmke (1963). The incidence has been estimated to be between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 2500 live births. The gene has been mapped to 12q22 in some families (Jamieson et al., 1994; Brady et al., 1997), however there is evidence for genetic heterogeneity.
    The main features are short stature, a short neck with webbing or redundancy of the skin, cardiac anomalies (particularly PS, ASD, VSD, PDA and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Burch et al., 1993), a characteristic chest deformity with a pectus carinatum superiorly and a pectus excavatum inferiorly, widespaced nipples and a characteristic facial appearance. The latter changes significantly with age. Left-sided heart lesions including anomalous insertion of the mitral valve, AV canal defects, and sub-aortic obstruction are occasional features (Marino et al., 1995 and Digilio et al., (1997). Coarctation of the aorta may also be a feature in 5-10% on the cases (Digillo et al., 1998). Occasional patients have a restrictive cardiomyopathy (reviewed by Wilmshurst and Katritsis, 1996). Nisbet et al., (1999) reported prenatal ultrasound findings in six cases. Abnormalities detected included nuchal fluid, short femora, plural effusions, hydrops and cardiac and renal anomalies.
    In the newborn period the main features are hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, a deeply grooved philtrum and a broad nasal tip. A history of polyhydramnios is obtained in about 33% of cases and feeding difficulties are present in about 75%. In later infancy the eyeslant may become horizontal and the facies can become coarser. In adults the facies may be more subtle. Mild retardation is seen in 35% of cases. 11% of cases need special education (Sharland et al., 1992). Left ventricular thickening can be progressive and may not be present at birth. Growth curves for children with Noonan syndrome are given by Ranke et al., (1988) and Witt et al., (1986). Thomas and Stanhope (1993) reported their experience of treatment with growth hormone in this condition. They concluded that it remains uncertain if growth hormone treatment will have a beneficial effect on final stature of Noonan's patients. De Schepper et al., (1997) produced similar findings. Elsawi et al., (1994) found that six out of eleven adult males had experienced bilateral testicular maldescent. This was thought to have contributed to delayed puberty, oligozoospermia and raised FSH levels.
    A bleeding diathesis can be part of the condition. Sharland et al., (1992) studied 72 affected individuals and found 29 with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time with partial factor XI:C, XII:C or VIII:C deficiencies in 36 patients. 
    Romano et al., (1996) described their experience with growth hormone in 150 children with the condition. They concluded that there was a significant improvement in 42 children monitored for four years. Thee of six boys reached an adult height greater than their pretreatment predicted values.
    Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (qv) may be the severe end of the spectrum of this syndrome. Legius et al., (1998) reported a family where some cases had features of CFC syndrome (although relatively mildly). The gene mapped to the Noonan region. Note that keratosis pilaris atrophicans has been reported in classic cases of Noonan syndrome (Pierini and Pieini, 1979).
    The mother and son reported by Seaver and Cassidy (1991) have Noonan syndrome, in our opinion. 
    Lacombe et al., (1992) reported a neonatal case with a 'molluscoid cutaneous excess' over the scalp that resembled cutis verticis gyrata. Ucar et al., (1998) reported a case with features of the condition who had a central giant cell granuloma of the maxillary sinus. Khan et al., (1995) reported a case with a vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma. 
    Schon et al., (1992) reported a case with a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Hinnant (1995) reported a case with thromboembolic brain infarcts and posterior arterial abnormalities of the brain. Robertson et al., (1997) reported a male infant with the condition who was born with chylothoraces and hepatosplenomegaly and had two episodes of cerebral infarction before the age of six months. Tanaka et al., (1999) reported two unrelated cases with cavernous haemangiomas of the brain. Clinical photographs of the patients were not provided.
    Cremers et al., (1992) reported a 23-year-old affected man with conductive deafness due to an absence of the long process of the incus. They reviewed the reports of conductive hearing loss in Noonan syndrome from the literature. 
    Fatourechi et al., (1982) reported a 23-year-old male with Noonan syndrome, obstructive cardiomyopathy and bilateral degenerative chorioretinitis. He also had red hair and an albinoid appearance. Ascaso et al., (1993) reported a 14-year-old girl with keratoconus and optic disc coloboma, however no facial photographs were published.
    Maximilian et al., (1992) reported three sibs with the Noonan phenotype but apparently normal parents. In view of the variability of the condition one of the parents could have been a carrier of the gene with minimal expression or a mosaic. 
    Connor et al., (1982) reported an apparent case with multiple odontogenic keratocysts, however this male is now known to have the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Fryer, 1993).
    Wilson et al., (1993) reported a 5-year-old boy with quite convincing features of Noonan syndrome and hypoparathyroidism and T-cell deficiency. He was found to have a deletion of the DiGeorge critical region at 22q11.  However Robin et al., (1995) and Digilio et al., (1996) found no real evidence for 22q11 deletions causing Noonan syndrome even when associated with tetralogy of Fallot.
    Henn et al., (1997) reported a family where Noonan syndrome seemed to be associated with progressive hydrocephalus. Fryns (1997) reported further cases with this association. In the index case NMR scan revealed agenesis of the corpus callosum and dilation of the 3rd ventricle. The affected mother was normal but her affected brother had massive internal hydrocephalus which included the 4th ventricle. 
    The authors know of several cases of Noonan syndrome with trimethylaminuria and it is interesting to note the report of Calvert (1973). 
    de Boode et al., (1996) reported two infants with features of Noonan syndrome, including hypertropic cardiomyopathy, who were found to have a myopathy. One died in the neonatal period, and one at 10 months. An excess of muscle spindles  was found on biopsy of striated muscle.
    Hasegawa et al., (1996) reported a 12 year old boy with coarctation of the aorta, renal hypoplasia, and some features of Noonan syndrome.  They postulated a mutation in a putative lymphogenic gene on the X chromosome that might also be responsible for the Turner phenotype.
     Bader-Meunier et al., (1997) reported four apparent cases associated with a myeloproliferative disorder. No further photographs were published. Side and Shannon (1997) suggested that some cases might be a manifestation of NF1 mutations. No photographs were published for the possible case of Noonan syndrome with moyamoya syndrome reported by Ganesan and Kirkham (1997). Saito et al., (1997) reported a twenty year old girl with severe developmental delay and seizures with features of Noonan syndrome. She was found to have cortical dysplasia of the left temporal lobe together with dilated perivascular spaces. The appearances were suggestive of a neuronal migration defect. </abstract>

    >This entry refers to the autosomal dominant and probably most common type of cutis laxa. The skin is redundant especially over the dorsum of the hands and feet, and on the face it tends to hang down in folds causing those who are affected to look prematurely aged. The skin is usually not hyperextensible and is not fragile.
    Jung et al., (1996) suggested that there is an autosomal recessive form which seems to have many clinical similarities to the dominant form but can be distinguished on morphological grounds. They named this autosomal recessive cutis laxa type III. Tassabehji et al., (1998) reported the affected daughter of a patient reported by Reidy et al., (1963). A frameshift mutation in exon 32 of the elastin gene was detected which resulted in a novel sequence of 62 amino acids at the C-terminus end of the protein.</abstract>

    > A three generation pedigree with seven affected members was described by Moore and Federman, (1965). The main clinical features of the condition were short stature, a hoarse voice, hypermetropia, mild hepatosplenomegaly, tight skin, decrease in joint mobility and a tendency to asthma. The proband had retinal detachment and glaucoma. The authors remarked on the similarity to Leri's pleonosteosis, however there are radiological changes in the latter condition not present in the Moore-Federman family. No further cases have been described, however there is marked similarity to acromicric dysplasia, which may be the same condition (Winter et al., 1989). Fell and Stanhope (1993) reported two further cases, including a follow-up of one of the cases of Winter et al., (1989). This latter case had developed subglottic stenosis requiring tracheostomy by the age of fourteen years.  Hennekam et al., (1996) discusses the overlap between geleophysic dysplasia, acromicric dysplasia and Moore-Federman syndrome.</abstract>

    >This condition should be recognized by immediate gestalt. It is the frontal prominence, the thin pointed nose and the small chin which are suggestive, especially in the presence of microphthalmia and cataracts. Slightly later the thinness of the skin around the nose, the forehead, and over the scalp will be noted. Neonatal problems, involving feeding and respiration, can probably be related to the small jaw and nose. The scalp hair remains thin and wispy and the facial features become sharp with age. Other problems include hypodontia. In general the outlook for normal intelligence is good, but mental retardation may occur in about 15% of cases. Most cases are single, and Cohen (1991) questions the validity of the few reports of familial cases. He provides an extensive review of 150 cases and suggests that the incidence of the various manifestations is - cataract 81-90%, microphthalmia 78-83%, dental anomalies 80-85%, hypotrichosis 80-82%, skin atrophy 68-70% and short stature 45-68%. Congenital heart defects are occasionally seen (Imaizumi et al., 1994).
    Christian et al., (1991) review the radiological features which include poor ossification of the skull with wormian bones and large fontanelles, thin ribs and long bones, metaphyseal widening, mild bowing of the radius and ulna in the neonatal period and platyspondyly. 
    Fryns et al., (1993) reported a 14-month-old girl with a 4q deficiency (4q33-ter) and a 14q duplication (14q32-ter) as a result of a paternal balanced translocation. There were some facial features of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (although not entirely convincing from the photographs published) and small central lens opacities. The patient reported by Schanzlin et al., (1980) with a 10q+ karyotype doesn`t seem to have Hallerman-Streiff syndrome although his distant cousin with normal chromosomes might have.
    The case reported by Amichai et al., (1996) is not entirely typical.</abstract>

    >    The original desciption referred to an absence of the proximal part of the femur with fibular or fibular ray defects and ulnar or ulnar ray abnormalities. It should be noted that the abnormality of the fibula is often on the opposite side to the deficiency of the femur.
    In the comprehensive paper by Lenz et al., (1993), analysing 491 cases, the authors point out that striking asymmetry is common, often with abnormalities just being unilateral. Upper limbs are more often affected than lower limbs, and the right side and male individuals are preferentially affected. Common abnormalities of the arms include amelia, peromelia of the humerus, and humeroradial synostosis, as well as the ulnar ray defects. There may be bifurcation of the distal humerus. Grogan et al., (1994) reported a high incidence of talocalcaneal coalition in patients with a combination of proximal focal femoral deficiency and fibular hemimelia. 
    In the series of 491 patients reported by Lenz et al., (1993) there was only one set of affected sibs, with normal parents.
    Czeizel et al., (1993) found that ulna-fibula deficiency occurred in 7 per 100,000 births. In 2/3 of cases a single limb was affected and most of the other cases had FFU syndrome.
    Treacy and Danks (1994) reported the unusual case of a 4-year-old female with complete amelia of the upper limbs with only a rudimentary right leg and a left leg consisting of a single tibia. She presented with an acute episode of metabolic acidosis with hypoglycaemia and marked elevation of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid. The authors postulated that the lack of muscle mass resulted in ketosis after a prolonged episode of vomiting and diarrhoea, because her diminished muscle mass could not supply gluconeogenic amino acid substrates or utilise ketones.
    The case reported by Capece et al., (1994), diagnosed prenatally, might in fact represent a case of fibular aplasia-oligodactyly-camptomelia (qv).</abstract>

    >This is the association between polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cutaneous pigmentation and precocious puberty. The fibrous dysplasia may involve any bone, although some sites are preferentially affected, such as the upper end of the femur. Involvement of long bones results in bowing, pain and sometimes fractures. Involvement of the bones of the skull results in facial asymmetry, prognathism and proptosis. Fibrous dysplasia of the skull may cause encroachment of the optic nerve. Bocca et al., (1998) suggest that aggressive intervention is indicated in these cases where there is acute visual loss. Radiographs of the skull may reveal hyperostosis. Cafe au lait spots of the skin are characteristic; they are usually large and are distributed asymmetrically with an irregular border. Rieger et al., (1994) suggest that in some cases the macules can follow the lines of Blaschko. Oral pigmentation can occur. There have been reports of cases associated with soft tissue myxomas, especially of muscle (reviewed by Gober and Nicholas, 1993). Schwartz et al., (1996) reported a 52-year-old man with fibrous dysplasia of the scalp. Yu et al., (1995) reported a case who had a linear sebaceous naevus, a corneal opacity, a conjunctival dermoid, and a coloboma of the upper eyelid. Rustin et al., (1989) also reported a case with a linear sebaceous naevus. In childhood this man was treated for rickets because radiographs of the pelvis and femora showed numerous Looser's zones and he had persistent hypophosphataemia.
    Precocious puberty occurs in 50% of affected females and in some males. Hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome are complications. When this occurs in the neonatal period the bone lesions may not be typical and there may be diffuse osteoporosis without obvious fibrous dysplasia (personal observation; Shenker et al., 1993) or widening of metaphyses with scattered irregular lucencies in the vertebrae, pelvis and long bones (Yoshimoto et al., 1991). 
    There are no convincing examples of familial cases in the literature. Alvarez-Arratia et al., (1983) reported a case where several of the family members had cafe au lait spots and subtle radiological abnormalities, however the evidence was not convincing that the condition was monogenic in this family.
    The condition is caused by somatic mutation of the GNAS1 gene for the alpha-subunit of G-protein, leading to overactivity of adenylyl cyclase (Schwingdinger et al., 1992). Mutations in the same gene have also been found in monostotic fibrous dysplasia (Shenker et al., 1995). Loss of function of the same gene leads to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (qv). Pienkowski et al., (1998) reported a case with a mosaic GNAS1 mutation where the only manifestation was an recurrent ovarian cyst.  
    Candeliere et al., (1995) studied 8 patients with various forms of fibrous dysplasia and found high levels of c-fos expression in bone lesions. This proto-oncogene codes for a nuclear protein that is part of the transcription factor AP-1. Two of the patients had GNS1 mutations. The authors concluded that increased adenylate cyclase activity causes increased expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.
    Liens et al., (1994) reported treatment of eight patients with McCune-Albright syndrome with pamidronate. Decreased bone pain was reported and four cases showed radiological evidence of thickening of cortices and refilling of osteolytic lesions.</abstract>

    >    The main diagnostic features are a short neck, a low posterior hair line and radiological evidence of fusion of the cervical vertebrae. In its simplest form this would consist of fusion of the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae, but there might be massive fusion and block vertebrae. The defect might also affect the upper thoracic spine resulting in a scoliosis. Additional features might include webbing of the neck, torticollis, and facial asymmetry. David et al., (1996) described seven cases associated with a split cervical spinal cord.  
    The vertebral anomalies have been classified into three types. In type I there is block fusion of cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae, in type II fusion of one or two cervical vertebrae associated with occipitoatlantal fusion and hemivertebrae, and in type III fusion of cervical and lower thoracic or lumbar vertebrae. Raas-Rothschild et al., (1988) reviewed cases with associated sacral agenesis and postulated a further group - type IV. 
    Helmi and Pruzansky (1980) discuss the associated findings which include deafness, which might be unilateral or bilateral, and either conductive or sensorineural. A cleft palate might also be a feature. The main cardiovascular lesion is a VSD. Renal pathology, which might vary from an absence of the kidney to minor changes in the collecting system, has been described.
    Neurological abnormalities, such as mirror movements, may also be seen. Most cases are sporadic, but semi-dominant inheritance has been described.
    Da Silva (1982) reported a large inbred pedigree where 12 individuals were diagnosed as having Klippel-Feil syndrome. Cervical vertebral defects were consistently present, however thoracic, lumbar and sacral vertebral anomalies, as well as rib fusion, were also present and this family is probably better classified as a form of spondylocostal dysostosis.
    David et al., (1997) reported 3 cases with what  they termed the \one bone spine\. This consisted of extensive vertebral fusions with an absent clivo-axial angle. There was a bone within bone appearance in 2 patients suggesting ossification of the notochord and perinotochordal sheath. 
    Clarke et al., (1995, 1996) reported a large dominant pedigree where a form of Klippel-Feil anomaly appeared to be segregating with an inv(8)(q22.2q23.3). Affected individuals had malformation of the laryngeal cartilages with speech impairment. Microtia, conductive deafness and restriction of supination of the forearms also appeared to be part of the phenotype in this family. Isomura et al., (1995) reported a patient with an apparently balanced t(5;17)(q13;q25). </abstract>

In the spine there was platyspondyly with biconcave deformity of the inferior and superior endplates in the thoracic region, and mild anterior wedging and irregularity of the endplates in the lumbar region. The femoral heads seemed to be particularly severely affected, but there was no limb shortening.

    >Clinically this disorder can be confused with rheumatoid arthritis. The distinguishing features are the presence of platyspondyly and a generalised bone dysplasia, and the absence of destructive bone changes. Wynne-Davies et al., (1982) described fifteen patients from nine families. Four families were Arab and one Greek. Teebi and Al-Awadi (1986) pointed out that the gene might have arisen a long time ago in the eastern Mediterranean region. The radiological features are those of a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with osteoporosis. Spranger et al., (1983) gave the name Progressive Pseudorheumatoid Arthropathy of Childhood (PPAC) to the condition and pointed out that it was probably the same as the condition described by Laplane et al., (1972). Legius et al., (1993) reported two brothers and a sister who were affected, but had normal height as adults. El-Shanti et al., (1997) reported six individuals from a multiple consanguineous pedigree and provide a good review of the literature.
    El-Shanti et al., (1998) and Fisher et al., (1998) mapped the gene to 6q22, close to the COL10A1 gene. Mutations could not be found in this gene but it was not totally excluded.</abstract>

    >The earliest age of onset is 18 months and most cases present before the age of 7 years. There is a cystic swelling of the jaw which increases slowly until puberty, then regresses, although there might be radiological signs in adulthood. The palate is often V-shaped, the speech is indistinct and the face seems symmetrically swollen at the level of the mandible. Sub-mandibular lymphadenopathy is nearly always present. Radiologically there are symmetrically placed, well defined, multilocular cysts or radiolucent areas, irregular in size, causing expansion of bone and thinning of the cortex. In adulthood the translucent areas are filled with a granular dense shadow and the jaw has normal contours.
    Bob Gorlin has seen a case with an 18q duplication (personal communication). Al-Gazali et al., (1993) reported a case with optic atrophy and short stature. Quan et al., (1995) reported a male with mosaicism for an FMR1 expansion, and deletion of the CGG repeat, who also had cherubism.
    Mangion et al., (1999) mapped the gene to 4p16.3 in two dominant families. Tiziani et al., (1999) provided similar results from four families.</abstract>

    >This condition affects the face bilaterally, but asymmetrically. The ear is small, often with preauricular ear tags in a line between the front of the ear and the side of the mouth, and there is macrostomia and failure of formation of the mandibular ramus and condyle. An epibulbar dermoid is usually insisted on as a diagnostic feature. Where this is absent, and both sides of the face are affected, the term first and second branchial arch syndrome is perhaps preferable. Where the face is affected only on one side without an epibulbar dermoid then the term hemifacial microsomia has been used. Okajima et., (1996) studied 592 patients with microtia and found that males were affected more often (65%) and the right side was more often more affected (58.4%). Six paitents were thought to have Treacher Collins syndrome and 27 patients were thought to have a first and second branchial arch syndrome.
    Cervical vertebral anomalies are common and should be looked for. Cardiac defects have been reported in 5-58% of cases - Kumar et al., (1993) review the types of lesion. Two-thirds of anomalies are either tetralogy of Fallot or VSD, however Kumar et al., (1993) found a wide variety of lesions including a double outlet right ventricle, pulmonary atresia, and infradiaphragmatic total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Maat-Kievit et al., (1994) reported a case with total situs inversus. Reid and Huff (1990) reported a similar association where the child had some additional features of VATER association. Lin et al., (1998) review cases of oculoauriculovertebral syndrome associated with abnormalities of situs. They note the association with maternal diabetes. Zelante et al., (1997) reported another case with features of VATER association and a complex congenital heart defect. Pridjian et al., (1995) reported a case with mosaic trisomy 22 who had features of Goldenhar syndrome. A further case of hemifacial microsomia associated with partial duplication 22q was reported by Hathout et al., (1998).
    Severe central nervous system involvement is rare but hydrocephalus, microcephalus, encephalocele and severe retardation have been described. This association is well reviewed by Schrander-Stumpel et al., (1992) who point out that intracranial lesions are more frequently associated with cleft lip/palate, and anophthalmia or microphthalmia. Inci and Saglam (1995) reported a case with syringohydromyelia. Michaud and Sheridan (1974) reported a similar case. Cohen et al., (1995) carried out detailed psychological assessments on 24 children. 58% of children scored 2 SD below the mean in at least one domain of development.
    Vento et al., (1991) introduced the OMENS classification standing for orbit, mandible, ear, cranial nerves and soft tissues. In each of these categories the abnormalities are graded from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). Horgan et al., (1995) used this system to analyse the defects in 121 patients and found that patients with extracraniofacial structural defects had higher OMENS grades. 
    Van Bever et al., (1992) reported 8 Brazilian cases with rarer manifestations of the condition including Rokitansky sequence, dextrocardia, fibrous dysplasia of the bones, hydrocephalus and porencephalic cysts (see above), radial defects and hemimelia. These rarer features can lead to overlap with CHARGE, MURCS and VATER associations (Van Meter and Weaver, 1996). Sutphen et al., (1995) reviewed 60 cases and found that 3 had tracheo-oesophageal fistula or oesophageal atresia. Ghose et al., (1992) reported a case with Peters' anomaly. 
    Inheritance is uncertain - irregular dominant families have been described (Herrmann and Opitz, 1969; Robinow et al., 1986; Regenbogen et al., 1982; Rollnick et al., 1983; Stoll et al., 1998). Some of these families include convincing cases of Goldenhar syndrome (Singer et al., 1994). On the other hand several discordant monozygotic twins have also been described (Boles et al., 1987; Burck et al., 1983; Connor and Fernandez, 1984; Ebbesen et al., 1982; Kawira et al., 1984; Setzer et al., 1981). Ferraris et al., (1999) reported a baby with features of Goldenhar syndrome in one of triplets derived from in vitro fertilisation. Harris et al., (1996) studied the epidemiology of anotia and microtia and found a prevalence of between 0.76 and 2.35 per 10,000. Between 30-50% had associated malformations and approximately 15% of these cases had Goldenhar syndrome.
    Mastroiacovo et al., (1995) review the epidemiology and genetics of microtia. In the Italian population the prevalence was about 1.5 per 10000 with 22% of cases having anotia and 66% having an isolated ear defect. A significant association with maternal diabetes was noted.</abstract>

    >The initial concern about maternal valproate ingestion in pregnancy was the increased frequency of neural tube defects, but a distinctive dysmorphic syndrome is seen in some cases (Clayton-Smith and Donnai, 1995). The proportion of infants affected when mother is on monotherapy is said to lie between 2.5 and 10%, however risk figures at the lower end of the range where there has not been a previously affected child, would seem to be appropriate (Friedman and Polifka, 1994). Clayton-Smith and Donnai (1995) suggest that where one child has been affected subsequent sibs might have a higher recurrence risk. Christianson et al., (1994) reported two sets of affected siblings. Williams and Hersh (1997) reported a case with features of autism.
    The craniofacial features consist of brachycephaly with a high forehead, shallow orbits and prominent eyes. The eyebrows are thin or 'neat'. There is said to be an unusual fold of skin below the lower eyelid. The mouth is small, the upper lip long and thin and the lower lip prominent. Limb abnormalities can include postaxial polydactyly, preaxial polydactyly (Buntinx, 1992) and radial defects (Verloes et al., 1990; Sharony et al., 1993; Espinasse et al., 1996). Hubert et al., (1994) reported a case with a scalp defect. In one prospective series (Jager-Roman et al., 1986) a major malformation occurred in four out of fourteen cases. The other worrying feature has been the high frequency of fetal distress which seems to occur in just under half of the infants. Overall assessment of all the photographs of affected infants suggests that metopic ridging and a long philtrum with a shallow, but well-formed groove may be characteristic. Boussemart et al., (1995) reported a case with an omphalocele. Barrera et al., (1994) reported an exposed infant with partial hydranencephaly. Mo and Ladusans (1999) reported two cases with an anomalous right pulmonary artery.
    Laegreid et al., (1992) suggested that benzodiazepines given with valproate might accentuate the teratogenic effects of the latter. In mice, valproate-induced neural tube defects can be prevented by giving folic acid to the mother.</abstract>

    >    Most affected infants are of low birth-weight. There is pronounced hypotonia, often a small head, and possibly jitteriness. This is followed by failure to thrive and mild to moderate developmental delay. The facial features consist of mild to moderate microcephaly, short palpebral fissures and a smooth, under-developed philtrum with a thin upper lip. The distal phalanges are small and the fifth fingernail might be dysplastic. The palmar creases are unusual in that there is often a deep extra line running across the palm from the ulnar side towards the gap between the middle and index fingers. Cardiac lesions occur in about a third of cases and the commonest malformation is a VSD, followed by tetralogy of Fallot and an ASD. It has been suggested that renal anomalies might be more common, however Taylor et al., (1994) did not find a significantly increased incidence of renal anomalies in 84 patients (3.6% had renal anomalies). The kidneys were, however, significantly smaller. Supernumerary nipples may be a feature (Urbani and Betti, 1995).  Note that some cases with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency can have similar facial features (Cormier-Daire et al., 1997).
     Johnson et al., (1996) discussed the central nervous system abnormalities in this condition.  These include agenesis of the corpus callosum, cavum septum pellucidum, ventriculomegaly, hypoplasia of the inferior olivary eminences, a small brain stem, and micrencephaly.  Frontonasal dysplasia and other midline defects may be associated. Swayze et al., (1997) reported MRI studies of 10 patients. Six had some type of midline anomaly ranging from partial to complete callosal agenesis to a hypoplastic corpus callosum or cavum septi pellucidi and cavum vergae. Other abnormalities included microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and hypoplasia of the inferior olivary eminences.
     Stromland (1985, 1990), Chan et al (1991) and Stromland (1996) discuss the ocular malformations seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.  The most common is optic nerve hypoplasia, occurring in up to half of the cases.  Other abnormalities include microphthalmos, cataract, anterior chamber anomalies, strabismus, ptosis, and abnormalities of the retinal vessels.
    Punctate calcification of the epiphyses, a cleft lip and palate (Munger et al., 1996) and renal anomalies have all been described. Froster and Baird (1992) presented evidence of limb defects in infants exposed to high alcohol levels in utero. The limb defects were mainly transverse, but two cases had ulnar defects.
    Streissguth and Dehaene (1993) studied fetal alcohol syndrome in twins of alcoholic mothers. They found that the rate of concordance was 5/5 for monozygotic and 7/11 for dizygotic twins. They concluded that there was a genetic component to the expression of the teratogenic effects of alcohol. Riikonen (1994) also reported discordant twins, although nothing is mentioned about zygosity. Haddad and Messer (1994) reported a remarkable family where three sibs had features of the condition.
    Astley and Clarren (1996) undertook a stepwise discriminant analysis of features from photographs of patients with fetal alcohol syndrome and concluded that palpebral fissure length, thinness of upper lip and smoothness of philtrum could discriminate between fetal alcohol and other similar syndromes.</abstract>

Patients present in childhood with short bowed limbs, a pronounced lumbar lordosis and a waddling gait. Radiologically the epiphyses are wide and the metaphyses flared, cupped and ragged. The course of the disease is relatively benign. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.
    Warman et al., (1993), Wallis et al., (1994), Dharmavaram et al., (1994) and McIntosh et al., (1994) demonstrated mutations in the type X collagen gene (COL10A1). Further mutations were reported by Bonaventure et al., (1995) and Wallis et al., (1996). Surprisingly, Rosati et al., (1994) found no phenotypic effect in mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the type X collagen gene. This suggests that the mutations in humans might be dominant negative, or gain of function mutations.</abstract>

    >    Gorlin et al., (1990) and Cohen and Gorlin, (1991) have pointed out the association between Noonan-like features, cherubism and polyarticular pigmented villonodular synovitis. The latter feature, when present, comes on before the age of 10 years and affects the knees and ankles and, less often, the wrists and elbows. The condition was first described by Cohen et al., (1974) in a white female who was normal until 11 years and then developed multiple lentigines on her back and forearms. She also developed warty lesions on the 4th and 5th fingertips of one hand. There was ocular hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, heterochromatic irides, a broad nasal bridge with lateral bony exostoses, posteriorly rotated ears, and a short webbed neck. She had a scoliosis, pectus excavatum, limitation of movement at the elbows, loose-jointed metacarpo-phalangeal joints, pulmonary stenosis, possible sensorineural deafness and moderate mental retardation. Serum calcium was repeatedly low and radiographs showed scattered cystic lesions in the short tubular bones, especially the hands and jaw.  Pathological examination shows giant cell lesions of the maxilla and mandible, long bones and synovial tissue. The condition has been described in a father and two children (Wendt et al., 1986).</abstract>

    >This well known syndrome was first described by Meckel in 1822. Gruber in 1934 reviewed the dozen or so cases reported since Meckel's report and added some personal cases. The main features are occipital encephalocoele associated with microcephaly, hydrocephaly or anencephaly, anophthalmia or microphthalmia, polymicrogyria, cleft lip and palate, polycystic kidneys, hepatic fibrosis and cysts, ambiguous genitalia, congenital heart defect and post-axial polydactyly. The most consistent features are the hepatic and renal lesions. Majewski et al., (1983) pointed out that preaxial polydactyly and bowing of the long bones can be part of the condition. Kjaer et al., (1999) examined the skeletal features in detail in three fetuses. Shen-Schwarz and Dave (1988) reported a case with polysplenia and dextrocardia and found two similar cases in the literature.
    Expression can be variable. For example Wright et al., (1994) reported two sibs, one of whom was classically affected, whereas the second sib was just found to have urethral atresia and preaxial polydactyly of the left foot. Nelson et al., (1994) reported a pedigree where the father of three affected sibs, and his cousin, had postaxial polydactyly of both feet. Wininger and Donnenfeld (1994) found one case of Meckel syndrome out of fifteen fetuses prenatally diagnosed with encephaloceles.
    Some infants have been reported with features of this condition, but with Dandy-Walker malformation (see renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia with Dandy-Walker malformation). Al-Gazali et al (1996) report a case with this combination and provide a good review of the literature. See also Yapar et al., (1996).  Ahdab-Barmat et al., (1990) reported that some patients have a distinctive triad of CNS defects consisting of prosencephalic dysgenesis occipital encephalocele and rhombic roof dysgenesis. 
    Gulati et al., (1997) reported a family where distant relatives had syndactyly or polydactyly and a sib had a cleft lip and palate. It was suggested that these might be heterozygote manifestations of the gene. 
    Paavola et al., (1995) mapped the gene to 17q21-q24 in 17 Finnish families. Roume et al., (1997) also reported North African and Middle Eastern families where the gene did not appear to be linked to markers on 17q.
    Paavola et al., (1997) presented data suggesting heterogeneity with the disease apparently not mapping to 17q in an Austrian, one caucasian and two Asian families. Roume et al., (1998) mapped the gene to 11q13 in seven North African and Middle Eastern families where the gene did not map to 17q.  
    Salonen and Paavola (1998) provide a good review of the clinical and genetic features of the condition. </abstract>

    >This syndrome consists of a form of acrofacial dysostosis resembling Treacher Collins syndrome combined with predominantly radial limb defects. The facial defects include an antimongoloid eye slant, malar and mandibular hypoplasia and small, malformed or low-set ears. The thumbs may be absent or hypoplastic and there may be hypoplasia of the radius with radioulnar synostosis. Thompson et al., (1985) reported a case with tetralogy of Fallot. Fryns et al., (1996) reported an adult with features of the condition who had mild mental handicap. Neurological examination revealed hemiparesis of the left arm and severe spastic diplegia of the lower legs with general hyperreflexia. Inheritance is uncertain because there is evidence for both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance in different families.
    Bonthron et al., (1993) reported an affected girl whose maternal grandmother had dysplastic thumbnails, and a maternal aunt had a \stub thumb\ (brachydactyly type D) as did the maternal greatgrandfather. The authors suggested that these might be minor features of Nager syndrome but this seems highly speculative. Zori et al., (1993) reported an affected female with an apparently balanced X;9 translocation (X;9)(p22.1;q32). The mother was phenotypically normal, but mosaic for this translocation. Waggoner et al., (1999) reported a convincing case with a 1q12-21.3 deletion.
    David et al., (1996) reported a child with overlapping features of MURCS association, Nager acrofacial dysostosis and VACTERL association.  There was bilateral aplasia of the thumbs, mandibulofacial dysostosis, left pulmonary agenesis, Klippel-Feil anomaly, and vertebral synostoses.</abstract>

    >There are several syndromes where broad thumbs are a feature. In order to make a diagnosis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome the characteristic craniofacial abnormalities should be present. These are microcephaly, antimongoloid eye slant, hypertelorism, long eyelashes, mild ptosis, posteriorly rotated ears and a convex nose with the columella protruding below the alae nasi on lateral view. The thumbs and halluces are broad, or occasionally bifid, with medial deviation. The tips of the other fingers may be spatulate. Dislocation of the patellar may be a common feature (Stevens 1997). The facial features become more marked with age. Stevens and Bhakta (1995) carried out a questionnaire survey that indicated that around 30% of cases have a cardiac anomaly. The most common lesions were a VSD, ASD and PDA. Lin et al., (1999) found similar features. Shashi et al., (1995) reported a case with a vascular ring causing tracheoesophageal compression. Miller and Rubinstein (1995) reviewed 36 cases where tumours have been reported. Neural and developmental tumours were common. Ihara et al., (1999) reported a case with a neuroblastoma and premature thelarche. Some cases may have keloids (Hendrix and Greer 1996). Central nevous system anomalies including Dandy-Walker malformations have been reported (Mazzone et al., 1989).
    Hennekam et al., (1990) noted that sleep problems are seen in about 10% of cases, possibly due to sleep apnoea. Collapse of the laryngeal wall may be a cause. This should be noted if anaesthesia is contemplated. In addition cardiac arrhythmia secondary to neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine has been reported (Stirt, 1981). 
    Most cases are sporadic. Several sets of concordant monozygotic twins have been described (Baraitser et al., 1983; Robinson et al., 1993). 
    Takeuchi (1966) reported less convincingly affected siblings. Hennekam et al., (1989) reported an affected mother and son and Marion et al., (1993) a mother and daughter, suggesting dominant inheritance. 
    Guion-Almeida and Richieri-Costa (1992) reported a convincing case with unusual association of an iris coloboma, a megacolon and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Cambiaghi et al., (1994) reported a case with multiple pilomatricomas (benign epithelial neoplasms with hair cell differentiation). Skousen et al., (1996) reported a case with a medulloblastoma however no clinical photographs were published.
    Imaizumi and Kuroki (1991) reported a case with a 2;16 chromosome translocation (p13.3;p13.3). Tommerup et al., (1992) reported a case with a de novo reciprocal translocation (7;16) and suggested localisation to 16p13.3. Lacombe et al., (1992) reported another case with a de novo inv(16)(p13.3;q13). 
    Breuning et al., (1993) demonstrated a deletion on 16p13 using FISH. This deletion was submicroscopic and could be found in 25% of cases.  Wallerstein et al., (1997) found submicroscopic deletions in 7 out of 64 patients with the syndrome (11%). Hennekam et al., (1993) could find no evidence of uniparental disomy and no clinical differences between patients with or without the demonstrable microdeletion. Petrij et al., (1995) demonstrated point mutations in the CBP gene. This codes for a protein that binds to the phosphorylated form of the CREB transcription factor. This increases the expression of genes containing cyclic AMP-responsive elements.
